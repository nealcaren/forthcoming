## Insights into Sociological Research

**üî¨ Serres' Influential Approach in Sociology Examined** This article explores the underutilization of Michel Serres' perspective in science and technology studies (STS) and sociology. It examines the blind spots in sociology caused by Eurocentric assumptions and highlights the importance of Serres' concepts of parasites and angels in understanding relations and communication. The research provides historical examples of Eurocentric parasitism and suggests the deployment of Serres' ideas for a more connected and equitable social science.

## Contemporary Education

**üè´üíº External Partnerships in NYC Schools** Partnerships between NYC high schools and external organizations can provide valuable social capital resources. An analysis of 211 schools and 918 partner organizations from 2001-2005 reveals that factors such as partnership duration, resource concentration, network connections, and resource type impact educational outcomes.

**üéì Study: Free college programs may be symbolic politics** Many 'free college' or 'Promise' programs may be exercises in 'symbolic politics' rather than tuition-reducing endeavors, according to researchers. A study of a Promise program at a community college found that cost concerns and the need for public appeal led to limited funding and many applicants falsely believing they had received a scholarship. The study explores the implications for higher education policy and organizational action. David B.  Monaghan, Paul A.  Attewell. *Sociology of Education* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00380407231183459)

## Migration and Mobility

**üåç Long-Term Impact of Labor Migration on Nonmigrants' Well-Being in Mozambique** Examining the long-term effects of labor migration on nonmigrants in Mozambique, this study uses unique longitudinal data to assess women's material security, economic standing, life satisfaction, and future expectations.

## Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration

**üì∞ Asian Americans Nearing Economic Parity with Whites** Asian Americans are reaching economic parity with White individuals, but income variations within Asian ethnic groups and across genders are masked.

## Gender, Work, and Family

**üíºüí™ Gendered Resources and Employment during the Pandemic** Married mothers were pulled away from employment as caregiving demands increased during the pandemic. Fathers' primary earner status helped sustain their employment, while access to telecommuting supported mothers' work attachment. Gendered resources were a stronger predictor of mothers' employment than rational choice explanations. William J. Scarborough, Caitlyn Collins, Liana Christin Landivar, Leah Ruppanner, Matt L. Huffman. *Journal of Marriage and Family* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12926)

## Health Inequalities

**‚öïÔ∏èRacial Disparities in Worries about COVID-19 Mortality** Black and Latinx individuals in the United States are more likely than Whites to worry about COVID-19 mortality. This study uses national survey data and finds that prior COVID-19 infection and knowing someone who has tested positive for the virus are linked to greater worry about COVID-related mortality. Social connectivity to family and friends affected by the virus explains a portion of the racial disparities in worries about COVID-19 mortality. Matthew K.  Grace, Ashley M.  Garc√≠a. *Sociology of Race and Ethnicity* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23326492231184837)

## Inequality and Exclusion in the Modern Workplace

## Social Movements

**üåç Protest Resonance Across Borders** This study investigates the mechanism of 'cathartic resonance' in cross-national diffusion of protests. It analyzes the motivations of Brazilian protesters inspired by the Turkish protests in 2013.

## Contemporary Relationship Dynamics

**üè† Migration Shapes Cohabitation Experiences** Rural-origin migrants in China, particularly those with longer migration durations, are more likely to cohabit compared to non-migrants. This finding is based on a mixed-method study using data from the 2012 China Family Panel Studies and in-depth interviews. Liberal attitudes, less parental supervision, desire to vet partners, and economic barriers to marriage contribute to this trend. Cohabitation reflects both life instabilities and a newly gained autonomy for migrants. Zheng  Mu, Wei-Jun Jean  Yeung. *Sociological Perspectives* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/07311214231180559)
