## Inequality and Social Dynamics

**üåé Income Inequality Measured by Median Income is 15% Higher than by Mean Income** This study examines how income inequality within countries plays an indirect role in how income differences are recognized between them. The analysis covers the 1990‚Äì2017 period for 123 countries. According to Theil‚Äôs T, median incomes are almost 15% higher and are converging about 7.5% more slowly than mean incomes, leading to a higher level of world income inequality that is converging at a slower rate. These results imply that the direct and indirect effects of national inequality account for about half of the world's income inequality.

## Environmental Sociology & Science Studies

**üëè Militaries amplify effect of economic growth on carbon emissions** This study examines how national militaries shape the effect of economic growth on carbon pollution using longitudinal models of emissions for 106 nations over 26 years. Authors theorize that both the size and capital intensiveness of the world's militaries enlarge the effect of economic growth on nations' carbon emissions. Findings support these propositions and contribute to sociological research on climate change and the climate crisis. Andrew K.  Jorgenson, Brett  Clark, Ryan P.

## Sociospatial Marginalization and Inequality

**üè† Routine dilapidation worsens housing precarity** This article explores how routine dilapidation, a mundane environmental housing issue, exacerbates housing precarity for low-income Black senior women in Chicago and New Orleans. The article identifies three mechanisms by which routine dilapidation worsens housing precarity, highlighting its impact on displacement, safe aging in place, and debt. Routine dilapidation also produces environmental injustice more broadly, and its effects are inherent in the contemporary US housing market.

## Contemporary Education

**ü§ùüèºBuilding lasting research partnerships through mutual commitment and shared learning** This article explores the challenges and solutions to creating long-lasting community-engaged research collaborations. The authors reflect on their 15-year collaboration and suggest that mutual commitment to supporting children and youth through play, and attention to positionality and shared learning, have created a platform for a lasting partnership.

## Gender, Work, and Family

**üåê Study compares housework and childcare responsibilities between female same-sex and different-sex parents in Spain and Sweden** Female same-sex couples promote a 'de-gendering' of family labor which fosters their psychological well-being, according to a study comparing housework and childcare responsibilities between female same-sex and different-sex parents in Spain and Sweden. Differences in the division of labor existed between same-sex and different-sex Spanish couples but not in Sweden. Satisfaction with housework distribution and personal time availability positively predicted life satisfaction, while problems related to work-life balance negatively predicted it.

## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**üî¨ Deliberate thought towards success** This study explores the relationship between cognitive processing and mastery. Through an interdisciplinary approach integrating research on mastery, dual-process models of cognition and intersectionality, the hypothesis is specified and tested using survey data in a diverse student sample (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ982). Deliberate cognitive style positively correlates with personal mastery. However, the correlation does not hold for East Asian women.

## Insights into Sociological Research

**üî¨ Age as a System of Inequality: A Multidimensional Framework** Age is ubiquitous in social science research, but is rarely treated as a phenomenon requiring explanation. We propose a multidimensional framework that conceptualizes age as a system of inequality. We review measures, including physical appearance, to account for age's complexity. Our framework highlights how age is "done" in interactions, connecting the social construction of age to the intersectional production of inequality.

**üîç Examining the Diversity of Empirical Research in Ethnomethodology** This article provides an overview of the vast range of empirical studies in ethnomethodology from the period of Garfinkel's initial release of Studies in Ethnomethodology in 1967 to the present day. The publication offers a comprehensive evaluation of the research, including various sociological theories, such as systems theory, and the study's empirical findings on everyday life, law, ability differences, and social sciences. The study offers an in-depth look at how the minority groups are considered in the research and the subfields that have been developed under the framework of ethnomethodology. Douglas W. Maynard, John Heritage. *Annual Review of Sociology* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-020321-033738)

**üìöüßë‚Äçüéì Examining the Teaching of Introductory Sociology** This article examines the evolution of introductory sociology in American higher education through an analysis of the textbooks used in these courses. Drawing on the scholarship of teaching and learning literature in sociology, the article considers current pedagogical practices and offers implications for the future of teaching in the discipline.

## Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration

**üîçLegal violence and immigration enforcement fuel educational disparity along the US-Mexico border.** Proximity to the US-Mexico border widens reading and math test score disparities between White and Latinx students, according to a Stanford University study. Legal violence and immigration enforcement are potentially impacting Latinx youths, increasing the size of the test score disparity in the region. Family-income differences explain math score disparity, but reading disparity remains net of community factors. The size of the test score disparity varies little across the four Border states.

## Reproductive Justice

**üß¨ Does medically assisted reproduction impact loneliness?** Using data from the Generations and Gender Survey, this study examines the link between medically assisted reproduction and loneliness in Central and Eastern Europe. The research shows that individuals who underwent medically assisted reproduction experienced increased social loneliness, which was entirely driven by respondents who did not have a live birth between the two observation periods, while no differences were found for emotional loneliness. These findings suggest that the MAR process might be linked to infertility-related stress and stigma.

## Family Dynamics and Education

**üë®‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶ Stepfathers may have an advantage in achieving fatherhood in complex families** Stepfathers may be better positioned than nonresident biological fathers to earn the father role in complex, disadvantaged families, according to a qualitative study of 55 in-depth interviews with adolescents and their primary caregivers. The incomplete institutionalization of the stepparent role benefited stepfathers in flexibly adapting to complex family dynamics and meeting their stepchildren‚Äôs limited expectations, while nonresident biological fathers were impeded by institutionalized expectations that led to tension and resistance in their relationships with adolescents.

## Migration and Mobility

**üè†üö´üìÑ   Exploring Legal Status and Housing Access** Undocumented and mixed-status Latino immigrant families experience limited access to formal rental housing in Los Angeles due to their legal status. They are excluded from most formal rentals because of background and credit checks, verifiable income, and banking information. As a result, they are forced to find sympathetic managers or double up with friends, family members, and non-kin to achieve greater housing security. These findings highlight how searches for rental housing reproduce inequality by legal status. Schmidt, Steven. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad021)

**üë•üíÄ Understanding Transnational Death and Undocumented Status** This study examines how unauthorized immigrants anticipate and mourn the death of family members in their community of origin and how their undocumented status creates challenges after a transnational death. Ethnographic and interview data collected from 2017-2023 with unauthorized Mexican immigrants and their families indicate that the death of a family member can significantly impact family structure and functions, and death and dying remain undertheorized in transnational family scholarship.

## Inequities in Education

**üßíüè´ Childhood Socialization and Inequalities** Sociologists have found that childhood inequalities promote social reproduction, but it is not always tied to social station. Two elementary schools were observed, one upper-middle class and one working-class to understand teaching and socialization patterns. Findings indicate that children from upper-middle-class schools were taught that they are always-already special while children from working-class schools were taught to adhere to external rules to be conditionally good. Implications for discrimination, identity rhetoric, and individualism on social reproduction are discussed.

**üåçüéì How socioeconomic background and gender intersect to explain patterns of social selectivity in German study abroad programmes** This article presents a longitudinal and intersectional approach to studying social selectivity in study abroad programmes, using data from the Learning Conditions and Student Orientations survey of German higher education students from 1994 to 2016. The authors find that social selectivity increased in study abroad programmes in Germany in 2003, with differences in cultural, economic, and social capital explaining this trend. The analysis also reveals that cultural capital is a key factor in the gender imbalance in study abroad programmes.
