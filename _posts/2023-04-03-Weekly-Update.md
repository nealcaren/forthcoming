## Education

**👨‍👧‍👦 Paternal Incarceration Affects Children's College Expectations** Using data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study, researchers found negative effects of paternal incarceration on children's perceptions of the likelihood of college graduation, particularly for Black youth. The study recommends that the educational expectations literature is updated to better account for the racialized implications of mass incarceration in the United States. Anna R.  Haskins, Wade C.  Jacobsen, Joel  Mittleman. *Sociology of Education* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00380407231167412)

**🧑🏿‍🤝‍🧑🏿 Study finds Black boys prefer informal familial support to address mental health needs** This study investigates Black boys' perceptions and understanding of mental health conditions such as depression through data from the Young Black Men, Masculinities, and Mental Health project. Findings revealed that this group - while well-versed in many of the causes, symptoms, and treatments for mental health challenges and depression - preferred to address mental health needs through informal familial support. The study emphasizes the importance of mental health education for Black boys and further research incorporating their perceptions and experiences. Williams, Ed-Dee G, Casanova, Allura, Watkins, Daphne C. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad018)

**👮‍♂️🤝👨‍⚖️ Investigating Ethnic Disparities in Confidence in Legal Authorities** Ethnic disparities in confidence in police and courts is further exacerbated in countries with high imprisonment rates. Research found that minority groups have significantly lower confidence in legal authorities, leading to unequal trust based on power balances between minority and majority groups. Punitive legal systems amplify these differences as minority members mistrust legal authorities that are trying to enforce inequality. Recommended policy changes are discussed in the article.

**📊🧐 Income evaluation consensus: inequity Z** This study analyses income fairness evaluations of 17,605 respondents from 28 countries. Respondents evaluated the fairness of their own incomes as well as the fairness of the incomes of the top and bottom income deciles in their countries. The study finds a Z-shaped pattern of income fairness evaluations within countries and shows that, across countries, the gap in fairness ratings between top and bottom incomes rises with income inequality. Fabian  Kalleitner, Sandra  Bohmann. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231167138)

**🎓 Expectation-attainment gaps & mental health** Educational attainment is associated with better mental health as it relates to realizing educational expectations. Expectations become more consistently associated with mental health over adulthood. Adult social roles and socioeconomic status explained little of these associations. Eun Hye  Lee, Jane D.  McLeod. *Social Psychology Quarterly* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/01902725231161072)

**📈Success reinforces personal beliefs** Does success reinforce the belief that admission depends on effort, and failure make people believe in luck? A study of German medical school applicants finds that self-serving bias outweighs the motivation for system justification, and this partly manifests in beliefs about societal inequality. The impact of previous experiences on new experiences and diverging paths in inequality beliefs of winners and losers are discussed. Rebecca  Wetter, Claudia  Finger. *Social Psychology Quarterly* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/01902725231165031)

**🏡 How Black Youth Adapt to New Neighborhoods** Interviews with 120 Black youth in Baltimore, who moved from high-poverty city neighborhoods to more racially diverse suburban neighborhoods, found that suburbs were viewed as safer but offered fewer opportunities for socializing with peers. Youth developed varied strategies for adapting to suburban cultures but their perception of a neighborhoods' qualities shaped where and how they spent time. Rhodes, Anna, Young, Allison, Darrah-Okike, Jennifer. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad015)

**📚 New study examines racial inequality in Advanced Placement courses** Examining school officials’ enforcement of performance-based selection criteria, this Wisconsin-based research finds that 'course gatekeeping' produces racially disproportionate effects on participation in Advanced Placement courses. Coupled with wider implications for highly selective colleges, it highlights how what students be may prevented from doing based on subjective assessments can reinforce racial disparities.

## Environmental Sociology

**🌳Du Bois and Racism** W.E.B. Du Bois's engagement with environmental themes has been neglected by sociologists. He prefigured contemporary scholarship on environmental racism, detailing colonial capitalism's uneven distribution of environmental benefits and harms. Du Bois is one of sociology's earliest environmental theorists, uniquely illuminating how environment-society relations shape racism. Ankit  Bhardwaj. *Sociological Theory* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/07352751231164999)

**👥 Study reveals attitudes towards Diversity Visa Lottery program** A study has examined US citizens' views towards the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which was criticised by former President Donald Trump. The study found that older citizens, those who identified as conservative/very conservative, and those who voted for Trump in 2016 favour eliminating the program, while Blacks, the more highly educated, and those who identified as very liberal/liberal oppose elimination. The findings have implications for group relations, policy, and future research. Daniel K.  Pryce, Joselyne L.  Chenane. *Sociological Perspectives* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/07311214231167175)

**📈Populist Rhetoric & Democracy** This study examines the relationship between populist rhetoric and liberal democracy. The analysis synthesizes voting behavior, Marxism, and pragmatism to develop a cognitive theory of populist resonance. Interviews in the American Rust Belt during Obama's elections illustrate that voters use populist rhetoric to simplify political decisions when cross-pressured. The analysis shows that populism is democratically functional in a stable party system, whereas illiberal populism is a symptom of enfeebled political parties. Josh  Pacewicz. *Sociological Theory* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/07352751231167389)

**👶💉 Vaccination Rates Declining** A decline in global childhood vaccination rates for diseases like measles, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus can be explained by the decline in confidence in liberal institutions and the empowerment of individuals. This endogenously emerged from the neoliberal turn of the 1980s and 1990s, leading to global cultural changes. Data from 80 countries between 1995 and 2018 were used to support this claim. Wade M.  Cole, Evan  Schofer, Kristopher  Velasco. *American Sociological Review* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231162869)

**📰 Grassroots COVID-19 mutual aid initiatives** The article examines grassroots mutual aid initiatives that emerged during Italy's COVID-19 pandemic as direct social actions to transform society itself. It analyzes their impact on solidarity politics, using qualitative interviews and contextualizing these initiatives in the longer history of direct social action. The article highlights the influence of the emergency temporality on political engagement and volunteerism, and offers insights into collective action during exceptional circumstances.

**🌪️ Disaster Aid Programs Deepen Inequalities** Disaster aid programs reinforce racial and socioeconomic inequalities, according to research analyzing 5.37 million FEMA applicant records. Institutional processes regarding eligibility conditions, burdens of proof, and assessments by contracted inspectors systemically favor homeowners in predominantly white communities for permanent aid, while temporary rental aid benefits households in communities of color. Aid for higher-income areas leads to greater benefits as benefits for temporary and home repair are decoupled. Climate risk adds to social risk faced by welfare states. Raker, Ethan J. *Social Forces* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soad050)

## Social Stratification

**👥 Aggression Weakens Status** Peer aggression weakens status hierarchies as it leads to inconsistent interpretations of onlookers, reducing the clarity of status distinctions. Clear status hierarchies emerge through coordinated reallocations of esteem, and whether peer aggression strengthens or weakens status hierarchies depends on the consistent perceptions of onlookers. James  Chu. *American Sociological Review* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231162867)

**🤝🌎 Friends' influence on prejudice** Cross-group friendship is often claimed to reduce prejudice, but competing influence and selection processes require consideration. Enriching research in the U.S., a network model showed that ingroup friends influenced intergroup contact attitudes over time, while open ICAs promoted selection into cross-group friendship among a diverse sample of high school students. The impact of intergroup contact is overstated in the context of friendship and more attention is needed to understand other friendship dynamics. Thoa V.  Khuu, David R.  Schaefer, Adriana J.  Umaña-Taylor, Allison M.  Ryan. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231161048)

**🛑 Women who don’t confront workplace harassment deemed less credible** This study uses survey data and experiments to understand how women’s credibility is judged when reporting workplace sexual harassment. Results show that Black women are deemed less credible than White women in the same scenario, while perceived credibility increases if the victim is younger and conforms to the idealized target of sexual harassment. However, the more factors a target conforms to, such as reporting harassment to the organization or assertively confronting the harasser in the moment, the more credible she is perceived to be. Hart, Chloe Grace. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad016)

**👥 Legitimacy & Ethnicity In Leadership** Leaders’ behaviors provide pathways by which they gain legitimacy at work. Impressions of competence and warmth mediate these behaviors' effects. Authority race alters the pathways; white managers operate via competence, while Black managers operate through warmth impressions. This study sheds light on how this process is racialized. Kate  Hawks, Karen A.  Hegtvedt, Ryan  Gibson, Cathryn  Johnson, Jamica  Zion. *Social Psychology Quarterly* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/01902725231162068)

**👥💼 Hiring for Skill vs. Cultural Matching** Employers may prioritize socially similar applicants when costly on-the-job skilling pushes for workforce stability. Recruiters for high turnover cost roles emphasized cultural matching while it played little role in other cases. The study highlights the implications of hiring-for-fit and on-the-job skilling for social inequality. Keenan Wilder. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12893)

## Social Movements

**🐢🌱 Examining the emergence of Extinction Rebellion in The Gambia** This article presents a case study of the formation of Extinction Rebellion (XR) in The Gambia as an example of further diffusion of the movement. It examines how partial democratisation opened up space for contention, which in turn led to the adoption of the XR brand in the country. The profile concludes by reflecting on the potential future of the group. Peter  Gardner, Thomas  O’Brien, Tiago  Carvalho, Olalekan  Adekola. *Social Movement Studies* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2023.2204428)

**👥🌱🇬🇷 Examining the role of the Millennial Generation in recent developments within the social movement field in Greece** This article explores intergenerational differences within the Greek progressive movement by examining Millennials’ perceptions and practices compared to older generations. Findings are based on 58 interviews and 44 questionnaires covering a wide range of progressive movements. While the Millennial Generation has substantially changed the social movement landscape in Greece, the research suggests a simultaneous change for all ages on some topics and intergenerational agreement with regard to others.

## Sociology of Health and Illness

**📊 Social media stokes fear of crime among young people** Exposure to crime-related content on social media paired with offline experiences of victimisation put young people in a state of fear, but also potentially hinders the development of important life skills. This study analysed survey data from nearly 1,700 individuals aged 20-34 living in England, and found that social media, individual and area-level victimisation all impact fear of being a victim of crime. These findings have important implications for policy makers and highlight a need to acknowledge fear of crime as a contributor to social inequalities and the well-being of communities.
