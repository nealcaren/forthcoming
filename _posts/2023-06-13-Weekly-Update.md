## Gendered Experiences

**👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 Gender-based occupational segregation linked to students' gender stereotypes** High school students in France show highly gendered professional aspirations, according to a study which distinguished between their 'dream jobs' and 'expected jobs'. The gender-based occupational segregation prevalent between women and men is not explained by a difference in professional ambition. Rather stereotypes around professional roles of each gender guides their career choices. More active intervention is required to dissuade gender stereotypes influencing career choice, and encourage women entry into 'masculine' professions.

## Contemporary Relationship Dynamics

**👫➡️👴 Men's health most affected by spouse's retirement** Our study uses fuzzy regression discontinuity design on data from Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine how men and women's health is affected by spousal retirement. We found that contrary to prior research, men experience more negative spillover effects on physical and mental health outcomes. Furthermore, our results indicate that non-working men experience worse health effects when their wives retire. These results have important implications for understanding the impact of retirement on spouses and the need to examine gender differences in spousal retirement effects on health.

## Sociospatial Marginalization and Inequality

**🏘️Study: Gentrification less likely in Black neighborhoods** Black neighborhoods experience marginal gentrification—changes in the educational level but not the income, compared to White or Latinx neighborhoods. This study explored the relationship between gentrification and racial change in Washington DC using Census and National Historical Geographic Information System data from 2000 to 2019. The study found a positive association between changes in the percentage of residents with college degrees and the percentage of White residents in neighborhoods that were majority Black in 2000. Different measures of gentrification, not only including income and home value but also education and race, should be used to capture its full extent.

## Violence and Justice

**🚨 Police media representation and racial justice protests** Media representations targeting a law enforcement audience, such as Police1, play an essential role in shaping public opinion on policing and racial justice protests. The authors use qualitative content analysis and topic modeling to analyze 2 years of news articles on Police1 to reveal how police work is represented as simultaneously dangerous and heroic, but accountable to broader legal and political structures. Likewise, by emphasizing the dangers of policing, the articles reinforce the policing warrior culture, while overlooking how policing systematically harms BIPOC communities.

## Societal Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic

**🏙️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🦠 Did the COVID-19 pandemic affect neighborhood social cohesion?** The COVID-19 pandemic did not lead to a significant change in perceived neighborhood social cohesion. Using data from the National Survey of Children’s Health, the authors examine trends in neighborhood social cohesion as reported by caregivers of U.S. children from 2016 to 2021. These findings reveal the durability of perceived neighborhood social cohesion, showing that it appears to be unaffected even by sizable changes in social and economic contexts.

## Family Dynamics and Education

**👩‍🏫👨‍🏫 White Parents Prefer Schools with Fewer Asian Students** Using a conjoint experiment, this article finds that White parents in the US strongly prefer schools with fewer Asian students. The study explores potential drivers behind these preferences and finds that the parents expected less student-level “fit” and less “commonality” with parents at schools with a larger Asian population. The research extends existing literature on race and school choice and highlights the importance of addressing anti-Asian discrimination in US educational settings.
