## The Carceral State

**📊 Study finds noncitizens punished more severely than citizens in US federal courts based on nationality** Noncitizens from most regions have higher odds of being incarcerated and receive longer sentence lengths in US federal courts, according to an analysis of United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) data from 2018 to 2020. This finding adds to previous research showing that noncitizens are punished more severely than citizens for equal offenses. The study draws from group threat and focal concerns perspectives to discuss its implications for the broader theoretical mechanisms behind the noncitizen penalty.

## Societal Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic

**🏳️‍🌈Impact of Pandemic on US Gay Bars** Gay bars in the US experienced major shifts in gender and racial composition in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to an analysis of historic data and two national censuses, the number of LGBTQ+ bars increased from a low point in 2021 to 803 in 2023. Bars catering to cisgender men and men's kink communities declined, while those serving men and women together doubled. Lesbian bars saw a small increase, while bars serving people of color saw a slight decrease. Greggor  Mattson. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231181902)

**🏙️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🦠 Did the COVID-19 pandemic affect neighborhood social cohesion?** The COVID-19 pandemic did not lead to a significant change in perceived neighborhood social cohesion. Using data from the National Survey of Children’s Health, the authors examine trends in neighborhood social cohesion as reported by caregivers of U.S. children from 2016 to 2021. These findings reveal the durability of perceived neighborhood social cohesion, showing that it appears to be unaffected even by sizable changes in social and economic contexts.

## Contemporary Relationship Dynamics

**👫➡️👴 Men's health most affected by spouse's retirement** Our study uses fuzzy regression discontinuity design on data from Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine how men and women's health is affected by spousal retirement. We found that contrary to prior research, men experience more negative spillover effects on physical and mental health outcomes. Furthermore, our results indicate that non-working men experience worse health effects when their wives retire. These results have important implications for understanding the impact of retirement on spouses and the need to examine gender differences in spousal retirement effects on health.

## Health and Well-being

**✍️ Structural stigma impacts life satisfaction of sexual minority individuals in Europe** Change in country-level structural stigma from 2012 - 2019 has been associated with change in life satisfaction among sexual minority individuals in 28 European countries. Results suggest that life satisfaction improved more in higher-stigma countries with changing laws instead of attitudes. The strongest improvement in life satisfaction was found among partnered sexual minority individuals. Further research is needed to understand the impact of structural stigma across sexual minority subgroups.

**🧠🤪 The Social Existence of Mental Health Categories** Exploring why certain labels can be mass-adopted to characterise mental distress, this article analyses the case study of sex addiction after its exclusion from the DSM in 1994 in Western cultures. Drawing on qualitative data, it proposes a theoretical framework for studying the 'social existence' of mental health categories by accounting for their appropriations in non-medical fields and circulation between them.

## Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration

**📰 Study Examines Xenophobia in Trump's Rhetoric Towards Latino Minorities** This article analyzes the role of xenophobia in Donald Trump's rhetoric towards Latino minorities in the United States thought the examination of public documents and speeches from 2020. The article identifies five Latino categories constructed through xenophobic strategies, discussing Trump's use of rhetoric to disguise race by characterizing undocumented Latinos as immoral and criminal. The study concludes with a comparison of the findings with the results of the 2020 presidential election, highlighting the growth of Trump's Latino base.

## Family Dynamics and Education

**👩‍🏫👨‍🏫 White Parents Prefer Schools with Fewer Asian Students** Using a conjoint experiment, this article finds that White parents in the US strongly prefer schools with fewer Asian students. The study explores potential drivers behind these preferences and finds that the parents expected less student-level “fit” and less “commonality” with parents at schools with a larger Asian population. The research extends existing literature on race and school choice and highlights the importance of addressing anti-Asian discrimination in US educational settings.

## Inequities in Education

**🎓 First-gen, low-income students benefit from self-advocacy skills in elite colleges** Self-advocacy skills, conceptualized as a form of cultural capital, can support first-generation, low-income (FGLI) students in transitioning to college, particularly in elite universities. Through interview and survey data from 40 FGLI students at an elite university, the study demonstrates how students who participated in pre-orientation more often demonstrate self-advocacy skills, both in-person and online, especially in comparison with those who did not participate. Forming relationships with peers, faculty, and staff, during pre-orientation is key to enacting self-advocacy. Lauren M. Beard, Kristen Schilt, Patrick Jagoda. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12923)

## Health Inequalities

**🤝💔 Study links racism-related fear to health outcomes in Black mothers** Vicarious racism-related vigilance, or concern about how racism may harm someone, has been shown to have a positive relationship with allostatic load in a sample of black mothers. Allostatic load is an indicator of underlying health that measures multiple biological systems. This underscores how race, gender, and parenting can lead to unique forms of health-damaging stress for Black mothers. Kathryn P.  Daniels, Marilyn  D. Thomas, David H.  Chae, Amani M.  Allen. *Journal of Health and Social Behavior* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00221465231175942)

## Sociospatial Marginalization and Inequality

**🏘️Study: Gentrification less likely in Black neighborhoods** Black neighborhoods experience marginal gentrification—changes in the educational level but not the income, compared to White or Latinx neighborhoods. This study explored the relationship between gentrification and racial change in Washington DC using Census and National Historical Geographic Information System data from 2000 to 2019. The study found a positive association between changes in the percentage of residents with college degrees and the percentage of White residents in neighborhoods that were majority Black in 2000. Different measures of gentrification, not only including income and home value but also education and race, should be used to capture its full extent.

## Gendered Experiences

**👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 Gender-based occupational segregation linked to students' gender stereotypes** High school students in France show highly gendered professional aspirations, according to a study which distinguished between their 'dream jobs' and 'expected jobs'. The gender-based occupational segregation prevalent between women and men is not explained by a difference in professional ambition. Rather stereotypes around professional roles of each gender guides their career choices. More active intervention is required to dissuade gender stereotypes influencing career choice, and encourage women entry into 'masculine' professions.

## Violence and Justice

**🚨 Police media representation and racial justice protests** Media representations targeting a law enforcement audience, such as Police1, play an essential role in shaping public opinion on policing and racial justice protests. The authors use qualitative content analysis and topic modeling to analyze 2 years of news articles on Police1 to reveal how police work is represented as simultaneously dangerous and heroic, but accountable to broader legal and political structures. Likewise, by emphasizing the dangers of policing, the articles reinforce the policing warrior culture, while overlooking how policing systematically harms BIPOC communities.

## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**📊 Why we turn to certain individuals for support** The authors of the study analyzed two data sets to examine how important role effects are in living kidney donation behaviour. They utilized a sample of kidney patients reporting on their support networks and surveyed kidney disease patients’ family members. The authors argue that our need for certain resources and social ties are key determining factors for whom we turn to in times of need. Jonathan  Daw, Ashton M.
