## The Carceral State

**üë•üëÆRacial Segregation and Disparities in Criminal Punishment** This article examines the role of Hispanic-White residential segregation in Hispanic punishment disadvantage. Using sentencing data from 2013-2017 in Pennsylvania, the study shows that segregation fosters greater Hispanic punishment disadvantage. The study also finds that segregation specifies the association between local Hispanic population size and Hispanic-White incarceration disparity. In counties with greater Hispanic population share and greater segregation, Hispanic defendants faced even greater incarceration disparities.

## Inequality and Social Dynamics

**üèòÔ∏è Childhood neighborhood disadvantage linked to reduced earnings in adulthood** Families with multigenerational exposure to neighborhood disadvantage have reduced earnings in adulthood, except for Blacks. Using cousin fixed effects models on NLSY data, this study theorizes that lingering racism and discrimination in the labor market affect Blacks' ability to benefit from better neighborhood attainment. The study reframes neighborhoods as durable features of inequality and refines our understanding of how neighborhood attainment affects social and economic mobility across race and ethnicity.

## Contemporary Education

**üìä How Accountability Policies Affect Student Motivation** Attendance at schools with high-stakes accountability predicted lower student self-efficacy and increased fear of failure but not social or life satisfaction, according to research on U.S. educational accountability policies. This effect on motivation is particularly detrimental for disadvantaged schools, reducing students' task motivation and resilience. These findings suggest that accountability policies, which use data to induce performance, can unintentionally reduce intrinsic motivation in students. The implications of the study are important for well-being, organizations, and education policy. Jose Eos  Trinidad. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231180387)

## Health and Well-being

**üì∞ Confederate Memorials and Black Mental Health** Study shows public Confederate memorials have negative associations with Black women's mental health. Merged data from National Survey of American Life and SPLC's census of memorials reveal that memorial counts are curvilinearly linked with depressive symptoms. High social cohesion buffers these effects, reducing the mental health impacts of residing near memorials in women. Ryan D.  Talbert, Jasmine L.

## Societal Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic

**üè†üí∏‚ö†Ô∏èCOVID-19 Financial Hardship Increases Anxiety and Depression for Renters and Homeowners** COVID-19 pandemic affected population mental health, hitting renters and homeowners who faced housing loss and financial hardship. Using household-level data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey we estimated linear probability models and found COVID-related financial hardship increased anxiety and depression risks. State eviction/foreclosure bans helped buffer mental health impacts . These findings point to the importance of state policies in protecting mental health and reveal state responses contributed to mental health inequities during the pandemic. Courtney E.

## Inequality and Exclusion in the Modern Workplace

**üè¢üë®‚ÄçüíºSelf-Marketing vs. Self-Preservation: The Precarious Job Search of Dislocated Workers in the US Economy** Displaced job seekers navigate insecure, nonstandard, and precarious work in the contemporary American economy. Qualitative interviews with 56 workers distinguish two kinds of job searching: self-marketing and self-preservation.Searches contain pathways to downward mobility, but neither flexibility nor passion offers protection against downward mobility in the post-Great Recession economy. The research demonstrates how neoliberal economy, asymmetric information problems, and bounded rationality leave workers vulnerable to cons, scams, and predatory business models. This study provides insight on how job search strategies impact current labor market upheavals. Lopez, Steven, Iba√±ez, Lindsey. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad030)

## Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration

**üçü Study challenges unidirectional model of dietary acculturation among Latina immigrants** Latina immigrants in North Carolina do not unidirectionally abandon their home country's dietary customs, instead strategically embracing and resisting parts of the dominant food culture. This study, based on 23 semi-structured interviews over 5 years, uses an intersectional approach to examine the role of food in the daily lives of immigrant mothers. The research shows that food decisions are complex, contradictory, and contextual. Political and economic structures limited their access to food and infringed on their autonomy to make food decisions. These structures contribute to what previous studies have described as dietary acculturation and reduce immigrants' autonomy, perpetuating inequalities.

## Gendered Experiences

**üßîüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Gender Categories Fragile for Boys** Boys who display feminine behavior are more likely to be reclassified as transgender, compared to girls who display masculine behavior. This according to a survey experiment that examined how gender is viewed by society. The results show that gender nonconformity is a gendered process and membership of a social category depends on status. This is the first causal evidence of the effect of gender nonconformity on perceptions of transgender identity.

## Healthcare Challenges

**üíä Clinicians Manage Negative Emotions with Opioids** Clinicians use opioids to manage the negative emotions that arise from dissatisfied pain patients in hospitals, according to a 21-month ethnography. To avoid engaging in emotional labor, clinicians either liberally prescribe intravenous opioids in a permissive prescription or conservatively prescribe IV opioids to reduce patients‚Äô time in the hospital. Using opioids to manage negative emotions leads to interprofessional conflicts that can shape patient care and workplace relationships.

## Reproductive Justice

**ü§∞üíä Pressure to use LARC resulting in reproductive disciplining of marginalized women** Reports of feeling pressured to use long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) were collected from 1,058 current users and 1,788 ever users in the 2021 Delaware and Maryland Survey of Women. The study found a high prevalence of LARC pressure, particularly among young mothers and economically disadvantaged, unmarried, and Hispanic women. Results reveal reproductive disciplining targeted at groups long subject to exclusion and marginalization in the context of a 'LARC first' policy. Mieke C. W.  Eeckhaut, Yuko  Hara. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231180378)

## Race, Identity and Power

**üëÄ White parents of Black adopted children experience racial scrutiny and resentment** White parents of Black adopted children must navigate challenges in the form of racial gaze, where they experience scrutiny directed toward themselves as parents and the bodies of their Black children. Drawing on 46 in-depth interviews with White adoptive parents of Black children, this study analyzes how White parents perceive and respond to racial scrutiny. They react with increased anxiety, hyper-vigilance, and greater guardedness around Black Americans in public to the point of resentment. Samuel L.  Perry. *Sociology of Race and Ethnicity* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23326492231182596)

**üåçüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüë• How is homosexuality perceived globally?** The study analyzes 85 countries from the World Values Survey data to explore whether homosexuality is classified as an identity or a behavior, and how people perceive homosexuality compared to other marginalized groups. Cognitive sociology and attribution theory are used as analytical frameworks to reveal a tendency toward identity classification in Western countries and behavior classification in non-Western nations. The results also show that perceptions of homosexuality are evolving over time to be more identity-affirming globally. Wade M.  Cole, Claudia  Geist. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231178426)

## Family Dynamics and Education

**üìà Study Shows Alternative Definition of Success Among Black Children of Incarcerated Parents** Black children of incarcerated parents face many negative outcomes, with recent studies focusing on success. This study highlights how adult Black children define success, which differs from traditional, Eurocentric definitions. Through 59 in-depth interviews, success was centered on education, mental health, relationships, and community involvement. Findings highlight that their personal networks and support allow them to succeed despite institutional and structural barriers. Policymakers, organizations, and schools can use these findings to create resources to invest in the futures of Black children of incarcerated parents.

**üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Privileged classmates boost upward income mobility for low-income children ** This study investigates how the presence of a high-income classroom friend (privileged friend) affects intergenerational income mobility. Using data from the Stockholm Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study, results showed that children with privileged friends had higher adult income, especially among those from the lowest parental income quartile. This indicates that having a privileged school friend can boost the upward income mobility of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.

## Contemporary Relationship Dynamics

**üíªOnline dating may contribute to more equal division of household labor among lower-educated married women** Meeting partners online may lead to more egalitarian divisions of routine household labor among lower-educated married women, due to the subversion of traditional dating scripts. 3305 women in marital and cohabiting opposite-sex unions were studied using 2008-2019 German Family Panel. Random-effects regression models revealed that online dating was associated with greater sharing of housework for married women with a lower level of education, and this effect was not mediated by partnership quality.
