## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**📊 Scoreboard Urbanism** Digital technologies could increase our emotional and moral attachments to the urban environment, creating a distinctive scoreboard urbanism. The paper argues that this transformation leads to a `gamespace` city defined by competitive and exhilarating drive to score points, rather than a blasé attitude towards muted emotions.

## Contemporary Relationship Dynamics

**💑💵Partner wealth sorting fuels wealth inequality, US study finds** New US-based research indicates that positive assortative mating is a driver of wealth inequality within and between households. Analysing data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the study examines the relationship between assortative mating and inequality within households, measuring individual-level wealth for newly formed couples. Its authors find that couples positively sort according to wealth over and above sorting by age, race, education, and income. They conclude that if couples did not match by wealth and remain within their current houses, wealth inequality would fall by 7%, with a within-household gender gap of about $23,000 to the disadvantage of women. However, the research suggests that random matching could offer women a substantial wealth advantage over men.

## Societal Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic

**🌍🦠 Rural Mozambican Women: Pandemic Disruptions Negatively Affect Social Ties** The economic decline caused by the pandemic has negatively impacted the quality of social ties between middle-aged women and their marital partners, non-coredsident children, and relatives in rural Mozambique, according to a study. The author found that the women's quality of life was positively impacted by strengthened familial ties and negative changes in quality of familial and other ties. These results underline the vulnerability of women in low-income patriarchal settings during times of extreme hardship. Victor  Agadjanian. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231171868)

## Social Movements

**🏳️‍🌈💬 How local LGBT+ activism can have downstream effects** Combining local movement visibility and cultural receptivity, this article offers a framework for understanding how LGBT+ activism can disseminate beyond its immediate surroundings. Using Bosnia as a case study, the study finds that even when local visibility is low, cultural receptivity can promote gradual diffusion of LGBT+ support, despite external challenges like the pandemic. The study's findings reveal the persistent power and limitations of LGBT+ activism in bringing about cultural change.

## Insights into Sociological Research

**📝 Drawing Public Attention to Sociological Research** This article examines the challenges and principles of communicating sociological research to broad public audiences and offer recommendations for increasing the impact of public outreach. The authors use their experience editing The Society Pages, one of the largest sociological hubs on the internet, as a case study and highlight the critical role of graduate students in these endeavors. They conclude that sustained public engagement results in benefits for the discipline.

## Gendered Experiences

**👩‍💻🚫 Researchers Explore the Impact of Cyber Harassment on Black and Asian Women** Drawing on interviews with Black and Asian women, the research investigates how these individuals negotiate cyber aggression. Women choose to confront racism or sexism online or not, depending on balancing their desire to respond with digital emotional labor. The study highlights the individual burden and toll that comes from implementing idealized responses to modern racism and sexism.  Paulina d. C.  Inara Rodis. *Social Psychology Quarterly* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/01902725231166377)

**🚨 Why Women's Crimes Go Unreported** Analyzing three affect control theory dictionaries containing 109 criminal behaviors, a new study explores the societal meanings surrounding gender & crime and how they contribute to the gender gap in crime data. The author hypothesizes that female criminal behavior is viewed as more deviant than a man's. When a crime produces a bigger gender gap in deflection in computer simulations, there will be a greater observed gender gap in alleged offending, as seen in victim self-reports, police reports, arrest data, and juvenile court statistics Kaitlin M.  Boyle. *Social Psychology Quarterly* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/01902725231167845)

## Sociospatial Marginalization and Inequality

**📊👥🏡 Black community formation during the Exoduster movement: A model of minority-majority group relations** This study analyzes the formation of Black communities during the Exoduster migration using archival information and census microdata from African-American communities in Kansas, Colorado, and Oklahoma. The study proposes a model of minority-majority group relations that predicts higher rates of minority business and community growth with increased spatial segregation and distinctiveness, but with an existential threat when these conditions converge. The paper examines the trajectories of several Black communities, including Nicodemus, Tulsa, and Langston, Oklahoma.

## Gender, Work, and Family

**👨‍👦‍👦 Fatherhood wage premium accumulates over time** Residential fatherhood in the USA is associated with an increase of 1.2% in wages per year lived with a biological child, according to a study. The research, which analysed data from 4,060 men in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, showed fathers' salaries begin to rise with the birth of a child, but that this wage benefit is minor. The study's findings highlight the importance of stable co-residential status for a fatherhood wage premium and show how family instability stratifies men's wages over their lives.

## Power, Politics, and Culture

**🧐 How People are Exposed to Extreme Political Content Online** This article discusses pathways to and perceptions of extreme political content and communities online. By interviewing politically active Redditors, the authors identify motivations for engaging with fringe political communities and argue these are important seeds of political extremism. The authors suggest implications for supporting healthy political discourse online.

## Contemporary Education

**🏳️‍🌈 The Stories and Numbers Project for LGBTQ+ Youth** The Stories and Numbers Project demonstrates how publicly engaged social science can support the LGBTQ+ community. The project focuses on LGBTQ+ young people's school experiences and the science of safe school strategies. The research was disseminated to LGBTQ+ students and their social networks. The project's success offers lessons for researchers to leverage for social change. Meg D. Bishop, Rachel A. Gonzales, Stephen T. Russell. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12903)

**📚 Research finds Head Start favors class-advantaged cultural capital while tuition-charging preschool encourages ownership.** Schools tend to favor cultural capital that class-advantaged students bring from home over that of their less advantaged peers. In this ethnography, two preschools were observed: a Head Start, and a tuition-charging preschool. The Head Start system treated predominantly disadvantaged preschoolers as low-status, whereas advantaged preschoolers were encouraged to take ownership and activate support from teachers and administrators. The authors argue that organizations can be agents of class socialization. Hannah W.  Espy, Freda B.  Lynn. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231171109)

**📊 Boosting the Impact of Community-Engaged Sociology through University-Based Research Centers** This article examines the role of university-based research centers in community-engaged sociology. Through three case studies, the author discusses common challenges faced by community-university partnerships and proposes recommendations on how to better support the work of such centers. The article provides insights into the factors that contribute to or impede the success of collaborative research projects and their broader implications for the field.

## Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration

**📝 Research on Black Immigration and Ethnic Identity** The article explores how Oromo immigrants integrate their ethnic and racial identities into American society. The study is based on 30 semi-structured interviews with first- and second-generation Oromo immigrants. Respondents distinguished between their Oromo and Ethiopian identities and embraced their Black identity through narratives of anti-Black oppression and linked fate. The study highlights the impact of subnational ethnic diversity on Black immigrants’ experiences and emphasizes the importance of examining this diversity in immigration research.

## Inequality and Exclusion in the Modern Workplace

**📝 Discrepancies in career and training increase dropout rates in VET** Downward gender-type discrepancies increase the chance of female apprentices dropping out of vocational education and training. Longitudinal data on 7205 German apprentices show that career compromises are crucial to decisions to exit a VET position. Findings draw attention to pre-entry VET policies like career counseling.

## The Carceral State

**📰 Study finds parental incarceration affects closeness between parents and children** Parental incarceration is negatively associated with closeness between youth and their incarcerated parents, according to a study that used data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Parental incarceration in early or middle childhood is negatively associated with closeness between youth and their incarcerated parent, whilst incarceration in adolescence is positively associated with closeness between youth and their non-incarcerated parent. Relationships between parents themselves explain some of the association between paternal incarceration in early childhood and father–youth closeness. Findings highlight how family ecological contexts contribute to inequality. Kristin Turney. *Journal of Marriage and Family* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12919)

## Structures of Power

**📈💪 New research shows historic communities of free African Americans are linked to lower racial disparities in modern-day social control.** Using quantitative methods, this study examines the relationship between antebellum free African-American populations and racial inequalities in modern state-sanctioned social control. The research shows that areas where free African Americans were more prevalent today display reduced levels of racial inequality in social control, and reduced absolute levels of minority social control. Contemporary civil rights infrastructure, Black congregations, and Black political power contribute to the legacies of resistance and resilience left by free African Americans.
