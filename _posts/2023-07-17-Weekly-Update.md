## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**üîç Study Reveals Disconnected Structure of Social Capital Research** Analyses using bibliometric analytic tools show that social capital research suffers from a disconnected structure, with multiple potentially conflicting definitions. The findings suggest that the confusion surrounding social capital stems from the existence of many nonoverlapping versions of the concept. jimi  adams, Kate  Vinita Fitch. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231184766)

## Inequities in Education

**üè´ Inequalities in Schooling: The Role of Within School Sorting** This article explores the persistence of inequalities in schooling, even in egalitarian school systems. Using classroom data on friendship networks in European secondary schools, the study compares comprehensive and tracked systems. The findings reveal that comprehensive systems reduce achievement sorting between schools but increase sorting within schools, classrooms, and friendship networks. Despite this, comprehensive schools still create more equal environments due to larger differences in between-school sorting and weaker associations between within-school sorting and social background characteristics. These findings shed light on why comprehensive schools produce more equal outcomes despite the persistence of substantial inequality. Per  Engzell, Isabel J.

## Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration

**üì∞ Attitudes about immigrants and immigration are distinct among Republicans and Democrats** Drawing on an original national survey, this article examines attitudes about immigrants among Americans. It finds that Republicans tend to agree with both anti- and worthy-immigrant narratives, while Democrats embrace worthy- and reject anti-immigrant narratives. The study sheds light on the complexities of immigration polarization and the role of social psychological mechanisms in shaping attitudes. Victoria S.

## Gendered Experiences

**üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Black Masculinity Policing in Gay Communities** Ethnographic data and interviews with young Black gay cisgender men reveal how masculinity is created and policed within gay communities, particularly among Black men. Sexual positioning discourse is integral to masculinity boundary work, asserting claims to Black masculinity while denigrating femininity. Terrell J. A.
