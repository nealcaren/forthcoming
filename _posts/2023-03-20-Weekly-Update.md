## Religion in Society

**🙏 Religious commitments and gender equality** Using a cultural approach to study religion, researchers find that public religious commitments, rather than personal piety, have a stronger relationship with support for separate gender roles and ambivalent sexism. These relationships do not hold for gender identity salience. Support for separate gender roles mediates the relationship between support for public religious order and the support for gender-equitable policy of paid family leave. Public religious commitments in the US are semi-autonomous from personal religiosity, with one public religious approach upholding a binary and complementary understanding of gender.

## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**👨‍👩‍👧‍👦💔🙅‍♀️: Family Ties Decrease Trust in Strangers** Replicating an experimental trust-game study, we find strong family ties stunt the growth of trust in strangers, supporting Toshio Yamagishi’s emancipatory theory of trust. Our study provides indirect evidence of causation and contributes to understanding classic ethnographic studies. John  Ermisch, Diego  Gambetta, Sergio Lo  Iacono, Burak  Sonmez. *Social Psychology Quarterly* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/01902725231162074)

**🧠 The concept of ambivalent action and its relevance to #BlackoutTuesday** This article proposes the concept of 'ambivalent action,' a category of moral action defined by conflicting intentions that are not resolved by the act, and examines its relevance to the #BlackoutTuesday social media movement created in response to global protests against police brutality and racism. Using interdisciplinary perspectives, including links to quantum physics, the article argues that the black square that characterized the movement's posts embodies both silence and speech, creating a duality that is interpreted by the audience.

**🌎Community Ties and Help** Community ties such as local neighborhood, associational, and friend relationships significantly increase the likelihood of accessing and providing practical help during a crisis. The helping behavior in the community is structured by social exchange. In a study of 4,234 Canadians and Americans during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship between community ties and the helping behaviors are mediated by social exchange, and individuals in need tend to both receive and give more help than others.

**🔬 Reassessing the Strength of Weak Ties Thesis** This article challenges the validity of Granovetter's strength of weak ties thesis. Its main contribution is to assess whether weak ties are actually bridges and if they transmit information effectively. The study reviews subsequent research and argues for the importance of identifying how actors' agency may affect social network value. The paper concludes by summarizing outstanding questions that progress on the SWT thesis has generated. Minjae Kim, Roberto M. Fernandez. *Annual Review of Sociology* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-030921-034152)

**📈 Life course adaptation model of personal culture.** Personal culture stability conflicts with growing evidence for change after significant life course transitions. This study develops a life course adaptation model with rich longitudinal data from six panel studies. Results support personal culture changes with prior biographical experiences, while within-individual changes are smaller than between-individual differences. Personal culture fluctuates substantially, with younger cohorts seeing increased variation over time. Philipp M.  Lersch. *American Sociological Review* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231156456)

## Health and Well-being

**👥 Social isolation tied to inequity.** Social isolation is linked to a greater risk of negative health outcomes, but there is a gap in research on the social conditions and systems that contribute to isolation over a lifetime. This article provides a conceptual framework for future research to understand the structural systems that fuel social isolation and identify policy levers to reduce isolation in vulnerable populations. Debra Umberson, Rachel Donnelly. *Annual Review of Sociology* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-031021-012001)

## Politics and Society

**🔍 New research explores human rights diffusion through global forum** The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is analyzed to provide new insight into human rights diffusion. The study converts roughly 50,000 recommendations from the first two cycles of the UPR into a relational dataset of states making and receiving recommendations. Results show that accepted recommendations tend to be more general and easier to implement. Studying partnership patterns suggest the existence of normative corridors that shape world society. Sendroiu, Ioana, Levi, Ron. *Social Forces* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soad020)

## The Carceral State

**📊 Marginalized Groups and Institutional Offloading** This article explores how marginalized groups are funneled towards increasingly coercive control. Using the unique case of crossover youth, I advance a conceptual framework of institutional offloading. The findings highlight mechanisms by which the pipeline to prison for marginalized groups may be perpetuated and disrupted.

## Environmental Sociology

**📰 Review Explores Challenges to Science's Legitimacy in the 21st Century** This review article discusses the challenges and threats to the legitimacy of scientific knowledge and expertise in the 21st century, including fraud, replicability, disciplinary fragmentation, polarization, authoritarianism, and economic capital. The study focuses on the publicly financed higher education sector worldwide, emphasizing that sociology is uniquely positioned to study these issues but faces its own legitimacy crisis. Gordon W. Gauchat. *Annual Review of Sociology* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-030320-035037)

**🌍🤝 Climate change mitigation as a form of global solidarity.** Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in wealthy countries is an act of prosocial behavior that benefits developing countries and future generations, who experience the negative consequences of climate change. The article explores the emergence of low-carbon behavior as a form of prosocial behavior, identifies four approaches to explain its origin, and discusses their scope conditions and limitations. The study of climate solidarity is proposed as a new interdisciplinary field of research that can contribute to the transition toward low-carbon societies.

## Sociospatial Marginalization and Inequality

**🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Nonprofit Service Inequities** Researchers quantify inequities in nonprofit service access for immigrant populations in California, Nevada, and Arizona. The study identifies spatial and socio-demographic mismatches affecting the safety net, highlighting the consequences of uneven access. Ethan  Roubenoff, Jasmijn  Slootjes, Irene  Bloemraad. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231157683)

**🐀🏙 LA's Rat Problem Tied to Homeless Encampments** Rats and homelessness are issues tied to the proper place of nature in cities, according to a new paper. Researchers found that managing urban nature means not just adding “good” nature but also keeping “bad” nature (e.g. rats) at bay. Homelessness and rat infestations challenge this goal as they compromise the indoors/outdoors divide. City institutions try to maintain this divide materially and symbolically to remove spatial transgressions. Andrew McCumber. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12890)

## Family Dynamics and Educatio

**👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Research on diverging destinies in East Asia** This article summarizes socioeconomic differentials in family behavior and relationships between family circumstances and children's well-being in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The article evaluates the diverging destinies framework using empirical research in East Asia. The results provide insight for subsequent research on family change and inequality in East Asia. James M. Raymo, Hyunjoon Park, Jia Yu. *Annual Review of Sociology* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-020321-032642)

## Race, Identity and Power

**🎥👥 Racial Diversity in Voice Actor Casting for Animated Films** This article examines patterns in voice actor casting among 850 characters from 170 animated films released from 1989 to 2019. Our findings show that racial inequality and white dominance are a categorical reality in the animated film industry, and that culturally specific film settings provide opportunities for voice actors of color. However, both color-blind and color-conscious casting can limit diverse and inclusive casting for imaginative characters. Minjeong Kim, Rachelle J. Brunn-Bevel. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12892)

## Inequities in Education

**🏫🌳 School and Neighborhood Contexts Matter: ‘Local’ Neighborhood-School Structures as Critical Components of Contextual Effects Research** This review examines the research on contextual effects on children’s educational, economic, and health outcomes, and critiques the tendency of researchers to evaluate which matters more between neighborhoods and schools. Instead, the authors recommend a reorientation that considers local neighborhood-school structures, including the ways families choose neighborhoods and schools and how neighborhoods and schools constitute each other. They propose how this new approach could lead to a deeper understanding of both outcomes-oriented research and contextual selection and segregation processes. Peter Rich, Ann Owens. *Annual Review of Sociology* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-031021-110311)

## Insights into Sociological Research

**📈 An Analysis of Interdisciplinary Diffusion in Culture and Cognition Scholarship** This study examined the interdisciplinary diffusion of Culture and Cognition scholarship through a bibliographic analysis of 16 key articles. The analysis found that while the majority of citations were from sociology, almost half were from other disciplines. The findings suggest that previous characterizations of Culture and Cognition's interdisciplinary uptake may have been exaggerated.

## Inequality and Exclusion in the Modern Workplace

**🤔 Tech Workers' Perceptions of Diversity in the Workplace** This article examines how tech workers view 'diversity' in their workplaces through in-depth interviews with 50 workers in the San Francisco Bay Area. Most respondents acknowledged a 'diversity problem' in the tech industry but saw their own companies as 'better than most'; however, these perceptions could cause a complacency that stalls progress. The study reveals the initiatives to increase diversity in the tech industry make workers believe that their companies are diverse but do not necessarily reduce racial or gender inequality. Luhr, Sigrid. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad014)

**💰👩🏽‍💼 National Gender Pay Gaps** Using merged data, a new study analyzes the contribution of firm, occupation, and job segregation to gender pay gaps in the US over the past decade. The authors find that reducing gender disparities in hiring and job assignment may be essential in reducing gender pay gaps. Joseph  King, Matthew  Mendoza, Andrew  Penner, Anthony  Rainey, Donald  Tomaskovic-Devey. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231157678)

**🏀 Study Explores the Matthew Effect in the NBA** A study investigates the impact of cumulative status bias on the feedback loop that leads from initial status allocation to status confirmation in the National Basketball Association. Researchers demonstrate that previous All-Star nominations improve a player's chances, confirming the importance of cumulative status bias. This effect undermines the meritocratic allocation of status and resources. Thomas  Biegert, Michael  Kühhirt, Wim  Van Lancker. *American Sociological Review* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231159139)

**📊Examining Racial Stratification in Work Environments** This research looks into racial inequality in work environments using a unique one million employee reviews dataset. The study theorizes two processes - worker sorting due to exclusionary practices, and spillovers from racial differences in occupation and geography. The results suggest Black employees experience disadvantage in areas with conservative racial attitudes and more prevalent workplace discrimination, while Asian employees score higher on work environment quality due to occupation, industry, and geography. Letian  Zhang. *American Sociological Review* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231157303)

## Power, Politics, and Societal Change

**🛢️Study examines power relationships and procedural justice in US unconventional oil and gas production governance** A study focused on the relationships among power, regulatory conflict, and procedural justice around unconventional oil and gas (UOG) production in the US by examining the Colorado Oil and Gas Task Force (TF) and its decision-making processes. The study's findings demonstrate how non-elected state interventions can reinforce industry power and lead to procedural injustices instead of disrupting them. Stephanie A. Malin, Stacia S. Ryder. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12883)

## Gendered Experiences

**🌈 Sexual Identities are Emerging in New Forms Among LGBTQ+ People** This article explores the emergence of sexual identities among the LGBTQ+ population, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning individuals. Drawing on theories of identity construction, intersectionality, and life course development, the authors review recent research highlighting the increasing complexity and intersectionality of sexual identities, including their intersections with race and social class. They also consider new work that situates sexual identities in the context of life stage and relational development. Stephen T. Russell, Meg D. Bishop, Jessica N. Fish. *Annual Review of Sociology* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-030320-032256)

**👩‍🎓 Women in Sororities & Rape Prevention** College women in sororities, who have a heightened risk of party rape, take on the labor of trying to protect themselves and other women at parties. They also blame institutions for failing to do more to keep them safe. Implications for research and policy on gender and sexual violence prevention in higher education are discussed. Simone  Ispa-Landa, Sara E.  Thomas. *Sociology of Education* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00380407231163799)
