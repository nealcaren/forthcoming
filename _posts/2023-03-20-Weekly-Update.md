## Governance and Power

**🛢️ Power relationships and procedural justice** A study focused on the relationships among power, regulatory conflict, and procedural justice around unconventional oil and gas (UOG) production in the US by examining the Colorado Oil and Gas Task Force (TF) and its decision-making processes. The study's findings demonstrate how non-elected state interventions can reinforce industry power and lead to procedural injustices instead of disrupting them. Stephanie A. Malin, Stacia S. Ryder. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12883)

**📊 Marginalized Groups and Institutional Offloading** This article explores how marginalized groups are funneled towards increasingly coercive control. Using the unique case of crossover youth, I advance a conceptual framework of institutional offloading. The findings highlight mechanisms by which the pipeline to prison for marginalized groups may be perpetuated and disrupted.

**🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Nonprofit Service Inequities** Researchers quantify inequities in nonprofit service access for immigrant populations in California, Nevada, and Arizona. The study identifies spatial and socio-demographic mismatches affecting the safety net, highlighting the consequences of uneven access. Ethan  Roubenoff, Jasmijn  Slootjes, Irene  Bloemraad. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231157683)

**🐀🏙 LA's Rat Problem Tied to Homeless Encampments** Rats and homelessness are issues tied to the proper place of nature in cities, according to a new paper. Researchers found that managing urban nature means not just adding “good” nature but also keeping “bad” nature (e.g. rats) at bay. Homelessness and rat infestations challenge this goal as they compromise the indoors/outdoors divide. City institutions try to maintain this divide materially and symbolically to remove spatial transgressions. Andrew McCumber. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12890)

**🔍 Human rights diffusion through global forum** The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is analyzed to provide new insight into human rights diffusion. The study converts roughly 50,000 recommendations from the first two cycles of the UPR into a relational dataset of states making and receiving recommendations. Results show that accepted recommendations tend to be more general and easier to implement. Studying partnership patterns suggest the existence of normative corridors that shape world society.

## Social Psychology

**👨‍👩‍👧‍👦💔🙅‍♀️ Family Ties Decrease Trust in Strangers** Replicating an experimental trust-game study, we find strong family ties stunt the growth of trust in strangers, supporting Toshio Yamagishi’s emancipatory theory of trust. Our study provides indirect evidence of causation and contributes to understanding classic ethnographic studies. John  Ermisch, Diego  Gambetta, Sergio Lo  Iacono, Burak  Sonmez. *Social Psychology Quarterly* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/01902725231162074)

**🌎 Community Ties and Help** Community ties such as local neighborhood, associational, and friend relationships significantly increase the likelihood of accessing and providing practical help during a crisis. The helping behavior in the community is structured by social exchange. In a study of 4,234 Canadians and Americans during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship between community ties and the helping behaviors are mediated by social exchange, and individuals in need tend to both receive and give more help than others.

**🏀 Matthew Effect in the NBA** A study investigates the impact of cumulative status bias on the feedback loop that leads from initial status allocation to status confirmation in the National Basketball Association. Researchers demonstrate that previous All-Star nominations improve a player's chances, confirming the importance of cumulative status bias. This effect undermines the meritocratic allocation of status and resources. Thomas  Biegert, Michael  Kühhirt, Wim  Van Lancker. *American Sociological Review* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231159139)

**📈 Interdisciplinary Diffusion in Culture and Cognition** This study examined the interdisciplinary diffusion of Culture and Cognition scholarship through a bibliographic analysis of 16 key articles. The analysis found that while the majority of citations were from sociology, almost half were from other disciplines. The findings suggest that previous characterizations of Culture and Cognition's interdisciplinary uptake may have been exaggerated.

**📈 Life course adaptation model of personal culture.** Personal culture stability conflicts with growing evidence for change after significant life course transitions. This study develops a life course adaptation model with rich longitudinal data from six panel studies. Results support personal culture changes with prior biographical experiences, while within-individual changes are smaller than between-individual differences. Personal culture fluctuates substantially, with younger cohorts seeing increased variation over time. Philipp M.  Lersch. *American Sociological Review* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231156456)

## Race

**🎥👥 Racial Diversity in Voice Actor Casting for Animated Films** This article examines patterns in voice actor casting among 850 characters from 170 animated films released from 1989 to 2019. Our findings show that racial inequality and white dominance are a categorical reality in the animated film industry, and that culturally specific film settings provide opportunities for voice actors of color. However, both color-blind and color-conscious casting can limit diverse and inclusive casting for imaginative characters. Minjeong Kim, Rachelle J. Brunn-Bevel. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12892)

**🤔 Tech Workers' Perceptions of Diversity in the Workplace** This article examines how tech workers view 'diversity' in their workplaces through in-depth interviews with 50 workers in the San Francisco Bay Area. Most respondents acknowledged a 'diversity problem' in the tech industry but saw their own companies as 'better than most'; however, these perceptions could cause a complacency that stalls progress. The study reveals the initiatives to increase diversity in the tech industry make workers believe that their companies are diverse but do not necessarily reduce racial or gender inequality. Luhr, Sigrid. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad014)

**📊 Examining Racial Stratification in Work Environments** This research looks into racial inequality in work environments using a unique one million employee reviews dataset. The study theorizes two processes - worker sorting due to exclusionary practices, and spillovers from racial differences in occupation and geography. The results suggest Black employees experience disadvantage in areas with conservative racial attitudes and more prevalent workplace discrimination, while Asian employees score higher on work environment quality due to occupation, industry, and geography.

## Gender and sexuality

**👩‍🎓 Women in Sororities & Rape Prevention** College women in sororities, who have a heightened risk of party rape, take on the labor of trying to protect themselves and other women at parties. They also blame institutions for failing to do more to keep them safe. Implications for research and policy on gender and sexual violence prevention in higher education are discussed. Simone  Ispa-Landa, Sara E.  Thomas. *Sociology of Education* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00380407231163799)

**🙏 Religious commitments and gender equality** Using a cultural approach to study religion, researchers find that public religious commitments, rather than personal piety, have a stronger relationship with support for separate gender roles and ambivalent sexism. These relationships do not hold for gender identity salience. Support for separate gender roles mediates the relationship between support for public religious order and the support for gender-equitable policy of paid family leave. Public religious commitments in the US are semi-autonomous from personal religiosity, with one public religious approach upholding a binary and complementary understanding of gender. Stewart, Evan, Edgell, Penny, Delehanty, Jack. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad012)

**💰👩🏽‍💼 National Gender Pay Gaps** Using merged data, a new study analyzes the contribution of firm, occupation, and job segregation to gender pay gaps in the US over the past decade. The authors find that reducing gender disparities in hiring and job assignment may be essential in reducing gender pay gaps. Joseph  King, Matthew  Mendoza, Andrew  Penner, Anthony  Rainey, Donald  Tomaskovic-Devey. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231157678)

## Environmental Sociology

**🧠 The concept of ambivalent action and its relevance to #BlackoutTuesday** This article proposes the concept of 'ambivalent action,' a category of moral action defined by conflicting intentions that are not resolved by the act, and examines its relevance to the #BlackoutTuesday social media movement created in response to global protests against police brutality and racism. Using interdisciplinary perspectives, including links to quantum physics, the article argues that the black square that characterized the movement's posts embodies both silence and speech, creating a duality that is interpreted by the audience.

**🌍🤝 Climate change mitigation as a form of global solidarity.** Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in wealthy countries is an act of prosocial behavior that benefits developing countries and future generations, who experience the negative consequences of climate change. The article explores the emergence of low-carbon behavior as a form of prosocial behavior, identifies four approaches to explain its origin, and discusses their scope conditions and limitations. The study of climate solidarity is proposed as a new interdisciplinary field of research that can contribute to the transition toward low-carbon societies.
