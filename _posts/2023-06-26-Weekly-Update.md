## Health and Well-being

**‚ö†Ô∏è LGBTQ+ Older Adults' Concerns in Long-Term Care Vary by Gender Identity** LGBTQ+ older adults who are gender-expansive are more likely to be concerned about mistreatment in long-term care settings, according to a nationwide survey. This study emphasizes the need for targeted policies and practices to address the unique concerns of gender-expansive individuals in the LGBTQ+ aging population. B. Savage, M. N. Barringer. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12928)

**üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Caregiving and Health of Young Adults** Young adult caregivers report poorer self-rated health than noncaregivers, particularly women caring for a spouse/partner, according to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Personal care and caring for an ill spouse/partner negatively impact young adults' health. Further research should investigate the off-timed life course perspectives of this phenomenon.

## Structures of Power

**‚è≥ How Newness Shapes Revolutionary Politics** This article examines the sociology of time by developing a tripartite model of social time. It analyzes the Chinese Cultural Revolution as a case study and explores the contradictions and difficulties in creating a widely experienced 'new time.' The findings highlight the impact of newness on revolutionary politics and provide a new angle on the sociology of political modernity.

## Contemporary Relationship Dynamics

**üíî Research shows widowhood effect in mortality rates** Mortality rates are higher among those who have recently lost a spouse. This study explores sociological explanations by focusing on the social connections of spouses. Using panel data, researchers find that the widowhood effect is stronger when spouses are not well connected to one's social network.

## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**üìä Cultural Participation and the Impact of Economic Crises** The impact of economic crises on cultural participation is a topic of debate in the social sciences. Using data from Eurobarometer surveys before and after the Great Recession, this study finds that a once-in-a-generation shock can significantly affect cultural participation rates, especially among the less educated. Omar  Lizardo. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231184968)

**üîì Study Explores Secret-Storytelling and Intimacy** Secret-telling-friendly methodologies were used to encourage individuals to share their life stories, including episodes and secrets. The research design and method played a crucial role in understanding the significance of secret-storytelling and its connection to wider social, gender, family, and normative values.

## Social Movements

**üì∞ Political Opportunities and Women's Reproductive Rights in Poland** Exploring the failure of social mobilizations for women's reproductive rights in Poland, this research examines the political context and argues that women's movements lacked strong roots in society. The ruling elites, Catholic Church, and state-controlled media have consistently curbed social movement demands.

**üé∂ Recreational Associations and Political Engagement** Using multilevel data on 25 community choirs and 1,032 members, this study examines the relationship between recreational associations and member political participation. Findings suggest that selection dynamics and interpretive mechanisms influence the link between recreational associations and political activity, highlighting the impact of organizational identities on civic life.

## Gender, Work, and Family

**üì∞ Mothers Face Worse Job Prospects and Lower Wages After Job Loss During Pandemic** Partnered mothers experienced more difficulties in finding re-employment during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to fathers, especially among those without a bachelor's degree. Mothers also faced lower job-level wages upon re-employment, highlighting gendered job segregation and inequalities in the family and work intersection. Yue Qian, Rebecca Glauber, Jill E. Yavorsky. *Journal of Marriage and Family* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12927)

**üë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶ Motherhood Widens Gender Gap in Occupational Authority** Mothers in the U.S. are less likely to have occupational authority compared to childless women. The motherhood penalty is larger for women with two or more children. Fatherhood, on the other hand, slightly increases married men's likelihood of working in authority occupations. This study highlights how parenthood exacerbates gender inequality in the workplace. Rebecca Glauber. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12924)

## Global Perspectives

**ü©∏ Menstrual Cups and Modernity: Exploring Empowerment Discourses** This article examines the websites of menstrual cup companies to uncover the ways in which these products are marketed as symbols of modernity and female empowerment. While menstrual cups are framed as empowering technologies, the persistence of menstrual stigmas is also evident. The analysis expands on feminist theories of technology and highlights the potential of these products to challenge patriarchal norms in various ways.

## Inequities in Education

**üéìüá∫üá∏ College Degree Boosts Sense of Dignity in America** Receiving a four-year college degree enhances a person's sense of dignity and respect from others, according to a new study. The authors analyzed national Gallup survey data from 2017 and 2021 to assess the subjective dignity associated with four-year college degree status, as well as various psychosocial and economic college-linked resources. The results show a college dignity gap as large as the difference linked to full-time work, with a lack of perceived socioeconomic standing being the strongest reason why those without a college degree perceive a lack of dignity in their lives.

## Health Inequalities

**‚è∞ Time Use and Racial Disparities in Health** Examining the role of time use in racial disparities in health, this article highlights the importance of time as a critical source of inequality. Drawing on fundamental causes theory, the research explores the mechanisms through which unequal distribution of time leads to unequal health outcomes among different racial groups. Cynthia G.  Colen, Kelsey J.  Drotning, Liana C.  Sayer, Bruce  Link. *Journal of Health and Social Behavior* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00221465231182377)

## Race, Identity and Power

**üì∞ Muslims in Spain: Internalizing Racism** Muslims living in Spain internalize cultural and ideological myths that sustain racism and Islamophobia. The study explores how religious and racialized minorities in Spain perceive and reproduce discrimination they face. Qualitative data from eight discussion groups of 61 Muslims reveal entwined forms of racism and Spain's historical relationship with Islam.

**üåç Western European Academia and the Exclusivity of Eurowhiteness** This article examines the concept of Eurowhiteness and its connection to Western European academia's treatment of 'outsiders'. It reveals how privilege and exclusivity are reinforced, hindering diversity and the free flow of ideas. The study also explores the impact of funding inequities within the European Union. Eastern European scholars' adherence to these exclusivist practices is discussed, raising concerns about their long-term ability to engage in original scientific research.

## The Carceral State

**üîç Indigent Reentering Citizens and the Perpetual State of Carceral Vulnerability** An examination of how an indigent population of reentering citizens make sense of their debts and develop strategies to increase personal autonomy within the constraints of family dependence, debt, and state supervision. The study uses case studies to illustrate the factors influencing individuals' decision-making, highlighting the perpetual state of carceral vulnerability faced by reentering citizens.

## Labor and Market Dynamics

**üå≥ Greenwork: Understanding the Devaluation of Labor in Urban Greening Initiatives** Urban greening initiatives rely heavily on unpaid volunteers and low-wage workers, despite their promises of economic growth and environmental improvement. This article presents ethnographic research and interviews with experts and volunteers in Chicago to explore why greening labor is symbolically valued but economically marginalized. The concept of 'greenwork' is introduced to explain this devaluation, highlighting the affective framing of urban nature, the stratification of labor, and the perceived self-sustainability of nature.
