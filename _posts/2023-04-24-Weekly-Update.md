## The Carceral State

**üîíüë©üèæ‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Study Highlights Intimate Carceral Violence in Black Communities** The study examines intimate carceral violence in Black communities, which includes the impact of carcerality on relationships in the community. The research involved qualitative interviews with 31 criminal-legal system-impacted Black women in Southern California. The study established how women engage in intimate carceral labor to mitigate their experiences of intimate carceral violence. Allison E.  Monterrosa. *Gender & Society* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/08912432231171169)

## Social Movements

**üì∞ Black millennials skeptical about BLM's ability to effect structural change** Using the concept of social movement prospectus, this article analyzes the varied conceptualizations of success within a group of 36‚ÄâU.S. Black millennials regarding the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and its potential impact on race relations in the United States. The study finds that Black millennials are more optimistic when change is viewed in terms of cultural outcomes than structural ones. Implications for BLM and social movement research are discussed.

**üîç Study Analyzes Far-Right Online Mobilization** This study examines the conditions necessary for sustained digitally networked action for far-right online activism by comparing a decentralized online far-right community (4chan/pol) to a centralized one (Stormfront). The analysis shows the cultural partialities of time-preference, anonymity, and affinity for experimental tactics, coupled with platform elements, sustain digitally networked connective action for decentralized communities, while organizational backing facilitates centralized collective action.

## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**üßê New ideas thrive** In the study, nearly 60,000 new scientific ideas were analyzed to identify the factors that enable them to diffuse across over 38 million later publications. Results show that ecological conditions contribute significantly to these successes after initial resonance. This broadens the understanding of scientific progress and values the role of intellectual structures. Mengjie  Cheng, Daniel Scott  Smith, Xiang  Ren, Hancheng  Cao, Sanne  Smith, Daniel A.  McFarland. *American Sociological Review* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231166955)

**üìöCultural Objects and Materiality in Contemporary Sociological Theory** This review synthesizes the third wave of cultural sociology, focusing on the study of cultural objects and their mechanisms of meaning-making to deepen our theories of culture. It offers interventions around meaning-making and action based on insights from scholarship on cultural objects and materiality, explaining how they shape meanings, social arrangements and cultural power of societies, and clarifies the concepts of cultural objects, material culture, and materiality.

## Reproductive Justice

**ü§∞IOL rates and race** Increases in induction of labor rates among Black and Latina women in the United States are not due to changes in their own risk factors, but instead driven by changes among states‚ÄôWhite childbearing populations. These findings highlight systemic racism in obstetric care and the need to center care around marginalized groups. Ryan K.  Masters, Andrea M.  Tilstra, Daniel H.  Simon, Kate  Coleman-Minahan. *Journal of Health and Social Behavior* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00221465231165284)

## Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration

**üë• Puerto Rican-Black intergroup relations** This study examines Puerto Rican-Black intergroup relations, feelings of belonging, and lack of sociopolitical agency contributing to perceptions of intergroup relations, using ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with 47 residents in Poinciana, Florida, a new immigrant destination. The study suggests minoritized groups may hold discordant conceptualizations of their relationship, what the author refers to as "cultural contention." Stephanie A.  Dhuman. *Sociology of Race and Ethnicity* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23326492231169249)

**üì∞ Study shows higher rates of coercive sterilization of Asian immigrants in California** Using complete count census microdata, this study examines the effects of eugenic sterilization programs on Asian immigrants in California during the twentieth century. The research finds that Asian-born women had higher sterilization rates compared with US-born and other foreign-born women, while Asian-born men had higher sterilization rates than US-born men before 1933. This quantitative analysis highlights the impact of discrimination on the health of Asian-Americans and the disproportionate sterilization of racial minorities.

**üåç Study shows how Latinxs resist racism through race-minimizing claims** Nuevomexicanos, a long-standing Mexican American population in New Mexico, presented rationales of cultural diversity or class inequality to deflect racism. The study argues that the region's Spanish and American legacies inform Latinxs' resistance strategies to claim equality with Whites, reflecting variations in Latinxs' conceptions of race. Salgado, Casandra D. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad004)

## Inequality and Social Dynamics

**üìâü§î Income Inequality and Justice** This study examines justice evaluations of income inequality among more than 72,000 respondents in 29 countries using data from the International Social Survey Programme and the European Social Survey. Results reveal that injustice of the income distribution prevails in all studied countries except Denmark, and injustice of bottom incomes prevails in all countries. Moreover, in the countries included in both the ISSP and ESS, the share of respondents evaluating the overall income distribution as just always falls between the share evaluating bottom and top incomes as just. Crist√≥bal  Moya, Jule  Adriaans, Carsten  Sauer. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231171581)

**üîçSES & Mental Health** This study analyzes the effect of welfare state spending & its spending categories on the relationship between socioeconomic status & depression in Europe. Findings indicate that social investment policies better address the differences created by SES disparities, & efforts in early childhood education, active labor market policies, old age care & incapacity care have a significant role in preventing depression. Matthew  Parbst, Blair  Wheaton. *Journal of Health and Social Behavior* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00221465231166334)

## Race, Identity and Powe

**üß° Love discourse sustains white racial ignorance** A love discourse is a seemingly apolitical way of addressing inequality that appears to address racial inequality while also sustaining it. A set of racialized emotions called a love discourse allows two organizations with different political cultures and value systems to engage in diversity work without actually challenging it. Love, in this sense, is a racialized emotion that sustains White racial ignorance. Diefendorf, Sarah, Pascoe, C J. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad019)

## Global Perspectives

**üë•üí• Intersectionality and Violence** Special Issue of the journal focuses on intersectionality in the examination of violence against women/non-binary people of colour. The studies included underscore the importance of gender, race, class, and sexuality in the analysis of violence. Pallavi  Banerjee, Maria Cecilia  Hwang. *Gender & Society* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/08912432231171444)

## Gendered Experiences

**üè¢üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Cisgenderism and Cissexism in Organizational Processes** Cisgenderism and cissexism are explored in organizational processes and how they harm transgender and non-binary people in cisgendered organizations. The author uses in-depth interviews with transmasculine and non-binary sex workers to develop a conceptual framework for analyzing these issues. They argue that cisgendered workspaces create two modes of exclusion, outright and categorical, and explore how these exclusions affect workers' access to critical resources and produce adverse mental health outcomes. Jones, Angela. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad017)

## Migration and Mobility

**üåçüë• Forced and Refugee Migration Research: Outcomes and Implications** This review examines the sociological perspectives and research on forced and refugee migration, and its outcomes and implications. It discusses the constraints and opportunities posed by the concepts of forced and refugee migration, and the tendencies of such research to serve policy and programs. Empirical research is reviewed through a social demographic lens, analyzing patterns of spatial mobility, health and well-being, social and economic integration, and family and community dynamics at different scales. The article highlights the importance of this research in addressing current global issues such as climate change and COVID-19, as well as providing critical opportunities for contributions by sociologists and social scientists.

## Health and Well-being

**üõå Social Roles and Sleep Health in Middle-aged Adults** This study examines how social roles impact sleep health among middle-aged adults using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Cohort. Results indicate that role accumulation and role repertoires affect sleep health, with contextual factors related to employment history, marital quality, and parenthood also playing a role. Gender differences in the relationships between social roles and sleep health were also observed. These findings suggest that multiple dimensions of social roles should be considered when addressing sleep health in middle-aged adults. Cleothia  Frazier, Tyson H.  Brown. *Journal of Health and Social Behavior* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00221465231167838)

## Family Dynamics and Educatio

**üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶ Prenatal motivations predict parenting style and child behavior** Prenatal motivations were examined as early markers of future parenting styles and child adjustment. 155 couples completed a 2-year longitudinal study from pregnancy through 20 months postpartum. Results revealed that childbearing motivations of both parents were positively associated with an adaptive, authoritative parenting style via parental competence. Lower-quality parenting styles were associated with controlled childbearing motivations and worse toddler behavior. Reut Nachoum, Anat Moed, Nir Madjar, Yaniv Kanat-Maymon. *Journal of Marriage and Family* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12917)

**üë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶ Childhood Disability & Maternal Health** Children with disabilities, usually seen as a burden, actually do not affect the health of higher socioeconomic status (SES) mothers. However, for lower SES mothers, early childhood disability tends to negatively affect maternal health. Ableism & poverty should be focused on, not disabled children being burdens. Laurin E.  Bixby. *Journal of Health and Social Behavior* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00221465231167560)

## Insights into Sociological Research

**üìù Sociology sees increase in coauthoring** Over 180,000 articles published in 110 sociology journals reveal that coauthoring has become increasingly common, with more than 55% of articles published in 2022 being coauthored. The trend toward coauthorship holds across regions and journal types despite some variability across individual journals. Dustin S.  Stoltz. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231171115)

**üìö Sociology's Racial History** Early Black sociologists integrated positivist and non-positivist approaches in their work to arrive at truth; privileging binary logic enabled marginalization in the canon. Moving beyond the positivism/non-positivism binary can help re-imagine foundational works and foster liberation. Vernon  Headley, Annie  Jones, Shannon K.  Carter. *Sociology of Race and Ethnicity* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23326492231170533)

**üî¨üß™Ecological pragmatist approach to scientific practice** An article proposes an ecological pragmatist approach to scientific practice that helps account for the meso-level environments in which scientists innovate. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, classic works in sociology and STS on cancer research innovation are reanalyzed to show how the distinct concerns for accountability in formal organizations help constitute the material and conceptual scaffolding that shape institutional transformations. The article concludes by suggesting ecological pragmatism offers a valuable perspective on recent efforts in sociology to conceptualize culture as cognition. Natalie B.  Aviles. *Sociological Perspectives* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/07311214231167173)

**üìä Advances in Causal Inference for Sociology: Machine Learning and Heterogeneity** Recent conceptual and computational advances in causal inference, focusing on causal effect identification, heterogeneity, mediation, and temporal/spatial interference, enable the incorporation of machine learning in sociology. This strategy empowers researchers to better address potential biases, uncover effect heterogeneity, and estimate causal effects in various social contexts involving networks and historical/life-cycle variations. The article encourages sociologists to integrate these insights into their empirical research. Jennie E. Brand, Xiang Zhou, Yu Xie. *Annual Review of Sociology* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-030420-015345)

## Violence and Justice

**üö® Feminist Intersectional Analysis: Kinship structures and crime reporting** This article examines system avoidance by analyzing how kinship structures shapes the reporting of crimes to the police. Employing the National Crime Victimization Survey, the research show that among Latinx and white groups, women are more likely to report personal experiences of violence to the police if they have children. Meanwhile Black women are more likely to report regardless of having children. The study reveals the paradox of protection, where women might not report crimes to protect their families from criminalization.

**üöî Police narratives perpetuate violence** Police use repetitious frames, styles, and storylines to dismiss and justify violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people. This article draws from interviews and testimonies to highlight how police actions perpetuate settler colonialism's ideological and material dimensions. Jerry  Flores, Andrea  Rom√°n Alfaro. *Gender & Society* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/08912432231171171)
