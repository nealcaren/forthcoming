## Family Dynamics and Education

**üë¥üìö Grandfathers' Education More Important Than Grandmothers' for Grandchildren's Education** Grandfathers' educational attainment has a stronger impact on their grandchildren's education compared to grandmothers'. Shared lifetimes between grandmothers and grandchildren positively influence educational attainment. The study analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study 1992‚Äì2018 (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ15,623).

## Gender, Work, and Family

**üì∞ Penalizing Men for Nonstereotypical Gender Roles Perpetuates Gender System** Examines how penalizing men who defy gender norms maintains the gender system. Data from online survey experiments with hiring decision-makers shows that fathers who used career reentry assistance are less likely to be hired than those who did not, while this penalty does not apply to mothers. Two years of full-time employment after reentry mitigates the negative effects for fathers, but stigma from previously leaving paid work for childcare still disadvantages them. This research sheds light on the impact of gender stereotypes and highlights the need for more equitable career coordination. Julia L.  Melin. *Social Psychology Quarterly* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/01902725231180804)

## Politics and Society

**üåç The Role of the State in Environmental Protection Explored in New Study** The article explores the role of the state in environmental protection and regulation. It defines the concept of the environmental state and identifies two key factors that shape its provision of environmental welfare. The study illustrates the importance of these factors in understanding the politics of environmental regulation and technoscientific expertise. Christopher M.  Rea, Scott  Frickel. *Sociological Theory* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/07352751231184462)

## Inequities in Education

**üìö Male Advantage in Test-Based Admissions in Germany** This study investigates the male advantage in test-based admissions to higher education in Germany. Using register data of 300,000 applicants to highly selective medical programs, the research finds that men perform better in admission tests and that female applicants are more likely to withdraw. Both factors contribute to a male advantage in admissions, offsetting the female advantage in school performance.

## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**‚úçÔ∏è Algorithms and the Elision of Narrative in Governance** Algorithms in governance tend to render people as cases, focusing on regularized attributes and computational predictions. However, this article argues that this elision of narrative has epistemic and moral implications, as different moral standards require different information. The study contributes to the sociology of categorization and sheds light on modern systems of governance. Barbara  Kiviat. *Sociological Theory* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/07352751231186797)

**üîç How social actors interpret aspirations despite limitations** This article explores how social actors make sense of aspiring selves despite social limitations and inequality. Using qualitative data from a study in Israel, the researchers introduce the concept of 'glitches' as articulated detours that arise in response to a mismatch between the aspirational discourse and lived experience. They identify three main glitches and argue that these enable individuals to sustain the aspirational discourse even in moments of doubt. Sari R. Alfi-Nissan, Michal Pagis. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12935)

## Migration and Mobility

**üîç How Bureaucracies Shape Inequalities** Examining the United States' refugee resettlement program, this research uncovers how administrative pipelines perpetuate imbalances in the allocation of scarce resettlement spaces. By analyzing government statistics, expert interviews, and documents, the study reveals the role of calculative rationales, administrative reactivity, and structured visibility in maintaining these inequalities. The findings highlight the influence of policy administration in shaping ethnoracial disparities in immigrant selection and offer insights into understanding social inequalities in various institutional contexts.

**üî´ Guns and Immigration: An Unexplored Relationship** Contemporary American gun culture supports anti-immigrant organizations through recruitment at gun shows and shooting ranges. The thrill of handling firearms mitigates the monotony of activism and reinforces nativist politics. This study urges scholars to consider the legacies of settler-colonialism and the role of guns in shaping immigration politics.

## The Carceral State

**üìö Research on social triage and exclusion in community services** This article analyzes perspectives and practices related to social triage and exclusion in community services. The research, based on two years of fieldwork and interviews with 105 practitioners, highlights how individual and systemic factors shape decisions about service eligibility. The study argues that current practices exacerbate social problems and contribute to punitive exclusions. Quirouette, Marianne. *Social Problems* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1093/socpro/spad035)

## Global Perspectives

**üì∞ Naked Body Protests and Liberatory Affective States** Study analyzes data from interviews with 16 women who participated in naked body protests in South Africa, exploring the liberatory affective states associated with such protests. The findings highlight the intertwined nature of affective states, gender performance, and social construction, with naked body protests having performative possibilities that both reify and challenge gender norms.

## Inequality and Social Dynamics

**üìà Rising inequalities and declining income mobility: New findings from Sweden** Income mobility in rich countries has declined, but previous research overlooks the impact of improved gender equality. A multiverse approach using register data on Swedish cohorts born from 1958 to 1977 reveals that intergenerational persistence in women's earnings and household incomes for both men and women have increased. This challenges dominant theories on childhood investments and highlights the need for a broader understanding of income mobility.

## Social Movements

**üåç Mass Movements in East and Southeast Asia** This essay explores the drivers and sustenance of mass movements in East and Southeast Asia in the face of institutional decay. It discusses the impact of democratic backsliding on mass mobilization, the relevance of protest leadership, and the role of network and coalition building. The review provides a comprehensive overview of defensive mobilizations in the region and their broader implications. Edmund W.  Cheng, Francis L.F.  Lee. *Social Movement Studies* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2023.2236032)

**üåç‚ôøÔ∏è Intersectional Organising in UK Social Movements** Analyzing intersectionality in the UK environmentalist and disability rights movements, this article explores how intersectional frameworks inform the ways these movements organize. The study uses discourse analysis of group websites and highlights the role of women of color in intersectional organizing.
