## Sociospatial Marginalization and Inequality

**üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë¶üèø US Racial Segregation Present in Everyday Mobility Patterns** Residential US racial segregation is not new; however, research from big data provides evidence that it is present in everyday movement patterns. An author analyzed 270 million visits between neighborhoods to estimate the effect of racial composition. Karl  Vachuska. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231169261)

## Insights into Sociological Research

**üìà Publicly Engaged Sociology: Challenges and Joys** The author explores their motivations for doing publicly engaged sociology and the challenges and joys that come with this work. They discuss their attempts to impact policy, shape changes in academia during the COVID-19 crisis, and collect and connect data to social theory, which has deepened their thinking as a sociologist and bettered their research.

## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**üì£ Communication as Stitching Social Structures Together** The concept of 'stitching' captures the simultaneous presence of multiple social and cultural contexts in communication. This article examines the complexities and interplay of multiple structures, or 'cross-field effects,' that shape patterns of expectations and structural couplings between contexts. The author argues that stitching creates the possibility of institutions spanning multiple fields, as well as the construction of actors with multiple involvements. Publics can foster communication between different contexts and help integrate them. Jan A.  Fuhse. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231171110)

## Race, Identity and Power

**üåç Study Reveals Prevalence of Biological Racial Beliefs in Europe** Beliefs in biological racial differences are widely spread in Europe, according to a study of 20 European countries. Researchers plotted the proportions of people who hold these beliefs and showed that the idea of races being born 'more hardworking' is a more socially acceptable form of belief than the idea of races being born 'less intelligent.' Interestingly, an east-west axis separates countries based on the prevalence of these beliefs about race and intelligence.

**üë¶üèøüë®üèª Teacher Perceptions of Noncognitive Skill Disparities Among Kindergarteners** Evidence of teacher racial-gender bias casts young Black boys as more often exhibiting poorer noncognitive skills compared to non-Black peers. No differences in teacher ratings of Black and non-Black boys' interpersonal skills was found. Findings were analyzed using sociological theories of racism to interpret evidence of racial bias in education.

## Healthcare Challenges

**ü©∫ Overconfidence and Self-Care Predict Health Information Seeking Online** The overconfidence bias and self-care practices predict online health information seeking, according to a cross-sectional survey of 783 Italian university students. Multiple linear regression revealed that the association between overconfidence bias and online health information seeking is mediated by self-care behaviors. Findings suggest further research is necessary to implement the overconfidence effect and self-care in theoretical models of health information-seeking.

## Societal Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic

**üë©üéìü¶† Pandemic challenges sexual scripts on college campuses** The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the sexual and romantic careers of college students, challenging traditional scripts of campus sexual culture. Through interviews with 40 'twenty-somethings,' this study found that for many young women, the pandemic offered a chance to prioritize autonomy while 'Covid consent' practiced by some lessened gendered risks of sexual violence and modeled mutual respect for boundaries. The pandemic had positive effects for sexual and racial minority participants, and those with physical disabilities as it strengthened their self-development and normalized their experiences. This article argues that pandemic challenges may point to healthier, more inclusive sexual scripts. Linda M. Blum, Kaitlyn Eri Lee, Olivia Binder, Emma Clifford. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12922)

**üî¨ Study finds pandemic negatively impacted sexual satisfaction among married adults** Married adults in the United States experienced a significant drop in sexual satisfaction following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a study analyzing data from August 2019 to August 2021. The effect was stronger for women and persisted for 18 months, with only a brief increase in the fall of 2020. Social factors such as age, education, and political affiliation played a role in predicting changes in sexual satisfaction over time. Elizabeth E.  McElroy, Samuel L.  Perry, Joshua B.  Grubbs. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231173899)

## Inequality and Social Dynamics

**üßê Investigating Cross-National Variations in Sources of Health Inequalities** This article examines how macro-level structures condition the sources of socioeconomic inequalities in health in 21 developed democracies. The authors develop theoretically grounded propositions about how different types of welfare states, varieties of capitalism, and social structures give rise to these cross-national variations. The article goes beyond the current welfare state literature and carries implications for policy and future research. Lucy  Barnes, Peter A.  Hall, Rosemary C. R.  Taylor. *Socius* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231231174832)

## Social Movements

**üßò Being as Prefigurative Politics: A Study of Contemplative Activism** This article explores how contemplative activism can be a form of prefigurative politics, where being political is a state of existence. It contributes to debates on the relationship between means and ends, temporal distinctions, and the actualization of goals, arguing that social change occurs on an ontological level, encompassing affective, embodied, and spiritual experiences as prefigurative changemaking.

**üß° Understanding emotions behind refugee solidarity activism** This article explores the emotions that sustain refugee solidarity activism and how they change over time using a diachronic perspective. The study was conducted between 2015 and 2021 in six countries in Europe, based on 40 in-depth interviews and participant observation. The article finds that reactive and moral emotions precede longer-lasting affective bonds, which help sustain engagement despite unfavorable circumstances.

**üë•üáÆüá± Movement against Backsliding in Israel: Factors and Impacts** Israeli movement against anti-democratic reforms analyzed. Three stages: origins, protest, and outcome discussed. Strategy separating local initiatives and effective pressure forms highlighted, including public involvement of experts and international players. Impact on legislation and public opinion observed. Future research proposed. Doron Shultziner. *Sociological Forum* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12921)

## Contemporary Education

**üè´ Schools' non-punitive approach correlates with students' expulsion risk.** Public high schools' move towards non-punitiveness puts staff in the position of rationing limited resources among students. Informal methods of exclusion become favored. Thus, disadvantaged students are at a higher risk of expulsion than privileged ones, and official data likely undercount the number of students forcibly removed from schools. As a result, decisions about who gets to remain a member of high schools become increasingly important for the allocation of public resources.
