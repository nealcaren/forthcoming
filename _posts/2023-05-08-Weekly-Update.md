## Gendered Experiences

**🏳️‍🌈 Study examines gender identity formation among gender minorities.** This article explores how gender minorities in the United States come to identify with new labels, theorizing gender identity formation as a social process. The research finds that participants' experiences involved self-reflection in relation to exposure to new gender conceptualizations, gender experimentation, difficult experiences, and/or conversations with others. Gender identity formation is a complex process that involves agency, mobilizing and building new narratives and discourses.

## Violence and Justice

**🔬 Study links white supremacist mobilization to backlash against racial and gender threats** This study utilizes defended neighborhoods and feminist perspectives - frameworks used to explain hate and extremist violence - to investigate legal white supremacist mobilization as a backlash response. Using data from the Anti-Defamation League, the study analyzed propaganda incidents at the county level between 2017 and 2020. Findings indicate that white supremacist mobilization is a backlash response to the influx of nonwhite, Black, and Hispanic residents into white areas, Jewish visibility as a measure of ethnoreligious minority group threat, and gender equality in income, occupational status, and the labor force.

## Inequities in Education

**🧮 New Framework Identifies Varied High School Math Progression** Using the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, the authors provide a new organizing framework for studying thousands of heterogeneous mathematics course-taking sequences. They identify eight distinctive typologies, revealing that roughly 45% of students do not take the expected four-year linear sequence of Algebra 1–Geometry–Algebra II–Advanced Mathematics. Membership into different typologies is related to student characteristics and school settings, highlighting the need for developing intervention opportunities and further research on stratification in math course-taking patterns and postsecondary outcomes.
