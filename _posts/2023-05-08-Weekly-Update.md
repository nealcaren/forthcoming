## Violence and Justice

**üåàüö® Gender and Racial Inequalities in Homicide of Transgender People in the US** Study presents original data set of murders of transgender people in the United States from 1990-2019. Findings reveal gender and racial gaps in homicide of transgender people far exceed those of cisgender people. Transgender women of color are murdered much more frequently than white transgender women, and are more likely to be killed while exchanging sex for money. The study uses the findings to explore ways to reduce violence against transgender people. Laurel  Westbrook. *Gender & Society* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/08912432231171172)

**üî¨ Study links white supremacist mobilization to backlash against racial and gender threats** This study utilizes defended neighborhoods and feminist perspectives - frameworks used to explain hate and extremist violence - to investigate legal white supremacist mobilization as a backlash response. Using data from the Anti-Defamation League, the study analyzed propaganda incidents at the county level between 2017 and 2020. Findings indicate that white supremacist mobilization is a backlash response to the influx of nonwhite, Black, and Hispanic residents into white areas, Jewish visibility as a measure of ethnoreligious minority group threat, and gender equality in income, occupational status, and the labor force.

## Health Inequalities

**üë∂ Neonatal Mortality and Intersectionality in Tanzania** Using an intersectionality framework and dependency theory, this paper analyzes changes in neonatal mortality in Tanzania from 1991 to 2016. Data from the Tanzania Demographic Health Survey reveals that while neonatal mortality decreased nationally, neonates in rural and low socioeconomic status areas were more likely to die. The analysis contextualizes these findings by considering structural elements within Tanzania from 1991 to 2016, providing fresh insights, recommendations, and policy discussion for reducing neonatal mortality in the region.

## Social Movements

**üì∞ News Coverage of Social Movements: A Study on Institutional Mediation** What drives the news coverage of social movements? This study elaborates an institutional mediation model arguing that the characteristics of the movements and the political contexts influence media coverage. Approximately 1 million news articles were analyzed over the 20th century to assess the model‚Äôs robustness. The results confirm the hypotheses, indicating an influence of the news values, routines, and characteristics of the news media on social movement coverage. This research highlights the role of structures and operating procedures of institutions in the influence of social movements on major social institutions.

**üìà#FridaysForFuture: Understanding Digital Movement Diffusion Dynamics** This paper explores diffusion mechanisms underlying digitally networked movements. It analyses a retweet network of the German-speaking #FridaysForFuture in its early stages and shows how the movement was facilitated through pre-existing networks, varying in issue salience and geographical localization. The study contributes to a better understanding of how digitally organised campaigns spread over time and among different publics.

## Gender, Work, and Family

**üí∞üë©‚Äçüë¶ Wealth, Gender and Work in High Income Households** Super-rich couples in the United States are much more likely than other couples to have a traditional male breadwinner and female homemaker/caregiver arrangement, regardless of income level. The study using Survey of Consumer Finances from 1989-2019, highlights that these gendered work-family arrangements contribute to wealth accumulation among the elite, perpetuating economic inequality. The findings shed light on work-family arrangements as an essential component of gender and economic inequality.

## Structures of Power

**üßê Risk and the Evolution of Capitalism** This article examines the transformation of risk from a property of groups to a property of individuals through the history of public and private insurance in the United States. The individualization of risk in recent decades reflects a conflict between security and freedom in capitalism. The ‚Äòpersonal responsibility revolution‚Äô emerged not through neoliberal policies, but through social movements contesting discriminatory insurance practices, revealing an unintended path to neoliberal capitalism.

## Gendered Experiences

**üö™üó£Ô∏è Exit-voice paradigm applied to neo-categorical gender politics** Cultural legitimacy of and institutional support for exit from binary gender categories is gaining ground in multiple contexts. The flexibility and selectivity of exit might lead to individualized, psychologically driven forms of voice rather than collective action. The exit-voice paradigm provides a framework to analyze the consequences and potential stabilization effects of this destabilization phase. Selective exit can reinforce stereotypical gender associations and hinder the transformation of the gender category system.

**üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Study examines gender identity formation among gender minorities.** This article explores how gender minorities in the United States come to identify with new labels, theorizing gender identity formation as a social process. The research finds that participants' experiences involved self-reflection in relation to exposure to new gender conceptualizations, gender experimentation, difficult experiences, and/or conversations with others. Gender identity formation is a complex process that involves agency, mobilizing and building new narratives and discourses.

## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**üßêNew research measures different types of novelty in scientific impact.** Different types of novelty and forms of scientific influence have been measured by researchers using data from the Web of Science and essays written by authors of Citation Classics. New methods tend to be more disruptive than new theories. New results don't have a robust effect on the nature of scientific influence. Erin  Leahey, Jina  Lee, Russell J.  Funk. *American Sociological Review* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231168074)

## Inequities in Education

**üßÆ New Framework Identifies Varied High School Math Progression** Using the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, the authors provide a new organizing framework for studying thousands of heterogeneous mathematics course-taking sequences. They identify eight distinctive typologies, revealing that roughly 45% of students do not take the expected four-year linear sequence of Algebra 1‚ÄìGeometry‚ÄìAlgebra II‚ÄìAdvanced Mathematics. Membership into different typologies is related to student characteristics and school settings, highlighting the need for developing intervention opportunities and further research on stratification in math course-taking patterns and postsecondary outcomes.

## Insights into Sociological Research

**üìàüìö Sociology and Science & Technology Studies: A Big Data Approach** Computational textual analysis was done using IBM SPSS Modeler to examine intersections between sociology and science & technology studies (STS). The study utilized a 'quali-quantitative' approach to identify political-economic and epistemic changes by analyzing three decades of STS journals (1990-2019) as well as conducting 76 interviews with STS scholars. The commercial analytics tool has not yet been used in sociological or STS research; this research highlights the methodological possibilities in analyzing large-scale data with a Big Data approach.

**üìä Graduate Students and Public Sociology** Graduate students 'devoting' their sociology career to public sociology may find support from established professors and need local, contextual knowledge to produce impacts. Sociologists who train students with public sociology values and treat students as publics create a meaningful understanding of the forms of social change. Such values are indispensable to identify opportunities for interventions in the midst of fieldwork and are crucial for the sociological imagination to maximize the impact of strategic projects.

## Race, Identity and Power

**üß¨ How Ancestry Testing Reinforces Racial Prejudice** A new article reveals a class assignment aimed at helping sociology students understand how DNA-based ancestry testing reinforces racial prejudices. Using YouTube videos featuring consumers narrating their DNA test results, students learn how race and ethnicity are social constructs, not biological traits. The article raises concerns around the impact of DNA-based technology in reinforcing dubious connections between biology and race. Luis A.  Romero, Amina  Zarrugh. *Sociology of Race and Ethnicity* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/23326492231172746)
