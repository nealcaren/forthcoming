## Sociospatial Marginalization and Inequality

**🏘️🔎 Examining Racialized Hazardous Space in Depression-Era Residential Security** This article applies a Critical Race Urban-Environmental Sociology (CRUES) framework to examine how Frederick M. Babcock's authoritative and discriminatory statements on residential security and neighborhood appraisals parallel and intersect with classic urban ecology to conflate racially segregated and environmentally hazardous neighborhoods. It also frames the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation’s (HOLC) worst neighborhood rating as racialized hazardous space, and proposes a future model to understand how racialized social threats and environmental hazards conditioned HOLC's hazard grade assignments during the Great Depression.

## Gender, Work, and Family

**👪 Can parental leave policies change gender norms in Germany?** Evidence-based information primers on income risks, paternal leave usage trends, and childlessness have varying effects on normative beliefs regarding the gender division of parental leave in Germany. Using a two-wave survey experiment, researchers find that respondents' judgments of fictional couple situations are significantly influenced by parental leave policy priming. Priming with information on income risks produces more significant normative belief changes compared with paternal leave usage trends, and the effects are more pronounced among childless respondents.

## Gendered Experiences

**👨‍🎓 📚 Program for men in female-dominated occupations found effective** Participation in the gender-atypical program, Germany's civilian service, increased the likelihood of men entering female-dominated occupations. The program was suspended in 2011, leading to a 21% decline in men's involvement in such occupations. Combining register data with German Microcensus indicates that having completed this service boosted male participation in female-dominated occupations by 12%, suggesting that gender-atypical learning programs can unstall gender integration.

## Health and Well-being

**📊 New data on self-labeling and mental health** Adopting a self-label can impede psychological well-being, while dropping one can increase self-esteem, according to a study of 427 sixth-grade youth over two years. These findings underscore the need for public mental health models to acknowledge the potential negative consequences of self-labeling. Lexi  Harari, Sharon S.  Oselin, Bruce G.

## Family Dynamics and Education

**📊 Parents' Dementia Risk & Education of Adult Offspring** Higher education levels among adult offspring has been linked to lower dementia risk in parents. A study of Black and White parents in the US found that children’s education does not account for the Black-White gap in dementia risk. Parental race, however, affects the relationship between offsprings' education and parental dementia risk among less-educated parents, and the association is stronger for Black parents. The study suggests that offspring education affects cognitive health differently across social groups. Jenjira J.  Yahirun, Sindhu  Vasireddy, Mark D.

**🍼 The Effects of Breastfeeding: A Study on Causal Effect Heterogeneity** This study examines the causal effects of breastfeeding, and finds that its effects may vary based on the propensity to breastfeed, thereby concluding that the social context not only shapes who breastfeeds in American society but also who benefits most. The research uses intergenerational panel data from the NLSY79 Child and Young Adult cohort to arrive at its conclusions.

## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**🤝💪💔 How Intergroup Conflict Shapes Social Status within Groups in the US** Intergroup conflict creates opportunities for individuals to gain or lose social status by demonstrating group commitment through status-worthy actions such as revenge or forgiveness. Through an original national probability sample and experimental survey design, this study examines how Americans value intergroup revenge and forgiveness across three group identities. The findings suggest that intergroup forgiveness is perceived as more status-worthy and a stronger indicator of group motivation than intergroup revenge in American society.

## Politics and Society

**📰 Article Explores Mutualistic Forms of Influence between Charismatic Leaders and Elites** Exploring more mutualistic forms of influence between charismatic leaders and elite representatives of traditional or rational-legal institutions, this article proposes a theory of charismatic mimicry based on Girard's notion of mimesis. The article illustrates the usefulness of this framework in the case of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's interactions with European leaders. Data analyzed include news articles and public speeches. Paul  Joosse, Dominik  Zelinsky. *Sociological Theory* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/07352751231174436)

## Reproductive Justice

**🚺🏛️ Abortion Restrictions Create Uncertainty in Reproductive Health Care** Ohio's 16 abortion-restrictive laws since 2011 are examined for the first time to understand their impact on reproductive health care outside of abortion clinics. Utilizing focus groups and interviews with genetic counselors and obstetrician-gynecologists, the research reveals that interpretation and implementation of legislation vary by institution and region of the state. This ever-changing legislative landscape along with uneven policy execution generates uncertainty in reproductive health care. Danielle  Czarnecki, Danielle  Bessett, Hillary J.  Gyuras, Alison H.  Norris, Michelle L.  McGowan. *Journal of Health and Social Behavior* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00221465231172177)

## Health Inequalities

**👶☣️ Infant Health Problems Limit Opportunities in Chicago** Infant health issues disproportionately affect socioeconomically vulnerable US communities. Using Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics’ Origin-Destination Employment Statistics, we find that infant health problems translate into reduced access to employment opportunities in the Chicago region. The community’s infant health status predicts isolation from the citywide employment network, with pairwise dissimilarity in infant health predicting a lower likelihood of mobility ties between communities. The study highlights that infant health problems perpetuate pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities and limit access to opportunities. Megan  Evans, Corina  Graif, Stephen A.
