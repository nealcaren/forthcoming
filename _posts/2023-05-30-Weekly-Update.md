## Cultural Dynamics and Social Interactions

**🤝💪💔 How Intergroup Conflict Shapes Social Status within Groups in the US** Intergroup conflict creates opportunities for individuals to gain or lose social status by demonstrating group commitment through status-worthy actions such as revenge or forgiveness. Through an original national probability sample and experimental survey design, this study examines how Americans value intergroup revenge and forgiveness across three group identities. The findings suggest that intergroup forgiveness is perceived as more status-worthy and a stronger indicator of group motivation than intergroup revenge in American society.

**🍼 The Effects of Breastfeeding: A Study on Causal Effect Heterogeneity** This study examines the causal effects of breastfeeding, and finds that its effects may vary based on the propensity to breastfeed, thereby concluding that the social context not only shapes who breastfeeds in American society but also who benefits most. The research uses intergenerational panel data from the NLSY79 Child and Young Adult cohort to arrive at its conclusions.
